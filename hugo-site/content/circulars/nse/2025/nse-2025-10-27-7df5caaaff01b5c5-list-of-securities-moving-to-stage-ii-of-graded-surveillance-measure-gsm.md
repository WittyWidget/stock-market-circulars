## Summary

NSE has announced that Gujarat Lease Financing Limited (GLFL) will be moved to Stage II of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective October 28, 2025. This escalation imposes stricter trading controls including trade-for-trade settlement, a 5% price band, and an Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of 50% of trade value to be deposited by buyers. The security series will also change from EQ to BE.

## Key Points

- GLFL (ISIN: INE540A01017) moves to Stage II GSM effective October 28, 2025
- Series changes from EQ to BE
- Trade-for-Trade settlement with no netting off allowed
- Price band restricted to 5% or lower as applicable
- Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of 50% of trade value mandatory for buyers
- Members advised to take adequate precautions while trading

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements Stage II GSM framework on GLFL, escalating from Stage I surveillance measures. The GSM framework has four progressive stages:

- **Stage I**: 100% margin rate with 5% price band
- **Stage II**: Trade-for-Trade with 5% price band and 50% ASD from buyers
- **Stage III**: Trade-for-Trade with 5% price band, weekly trading (Mondays only), and 100% ASD
- **Stage IV**: Stage III restrictions plus no upward movement allowed

The security series designation changes from EQ (Equity) to BE (Book Entry/Special Surveillance).

## Compliance Requirements

- **Buyers**: Must deposit Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of 50% of trade value
- **All Members**: Trade on a trade-for-trade basis only - no netting off permitted
- **Settlement**: Gross settlement on trade-to-trade basis mandatory
- **Trading Controls**: Adhere to 5% or lower price band restrictions
- Members must exercise adequate precautions when trading in this security

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 27, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 28, 2025 - Stage II GSM measures become applicable for GLFL

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Severe restrictions on GLFL trading with mandatory trade-for-trade settlement eliminating netting opportunities, significantly reducing liquidity and increasing settlement obligations.

**Financial Impact**: Buyers face substantial capital requirements with 50% ASD on top of regular margin requirements, potentially deterring participation and reducing trading volumes.

**Market Impact**: Series change from EQ to BE signals heightened surveillance status, likely affecting investor confidence and institutional participation. Price discovery may be impaired due to the 5% price band restriction.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may face difficulty exiting positions due to reduced liquidity, while new buyers face higher capital deployment requirements and settlement risks.
