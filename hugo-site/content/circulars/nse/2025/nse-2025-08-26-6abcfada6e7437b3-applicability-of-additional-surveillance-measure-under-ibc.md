  Added to ASM Stage I
---

## Summary

NSE has applied Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to Eastern Silk Industries Limited (EASTSILK) effective August 28, 2025. The security has been placed in ASM Stage I. No securities were excluded from ASM or moved between stages.

## Key Points

- Eastern Silk Industries Limited (EASTSILK, ISIN: INE962C01035) added to ASM IBC Stage I
- No securities excluded from ASM IBC framework
- No securities moved between ASM stages
- ASM IBC framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. The circular implements existing ASM IBC framework as per previous circulars NSE/SURV/37979 (June 08, 2018), NSE/SURV/52368 (May 20, 2022), and NSE/SURV/55582 (February 10, 2023).

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note ASM IBC framework applies alongside other surveillance measures
- Trading in EASTSILK subject to additional surveillance monitoring
- Members should refer to existing ASM IBC guidelines for trading procedures

## Important Dates

- **August 28, 2025**: Effective date for ASM IBC application to Eastern Silk Industries Limited

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as only one security affected. Eastern Silk Industries Limited will be subject to enhanced surveillance monitoring under IBC framework. The measure is precautionary and surveillance-based rather than punitive. Trading can continue but with additional monitoring protocols in place.
