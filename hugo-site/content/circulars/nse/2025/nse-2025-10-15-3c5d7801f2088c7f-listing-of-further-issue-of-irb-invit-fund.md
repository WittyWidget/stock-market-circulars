## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**:
- **Supply Increase**: Addition of 541.4 million tradable units represents significant expansion of free float, potentially increasing liquidity
- **Dilution**: Existing unitholders will experience dilution depending on pre-QIP unit base
- **Capital Infusion**: Rs. 32,484+ crores raised will strengthen IRB InvIT's capacity for infrastructure acquisitions and debt reduction

**Operational Impact**:
- Infrastructure investment trusts use QIP proceeds typically for acquiring operational toll road assets or repaying debt
- Increased unit base may impact distribution per unit (DPU) calculations going forward
- Institutional investor participation through QIP enhances credibility and trading depth

**Investor Considerations**:
- No lock-in period allows immediate trading liquidity for QIP investors
- Pari passu status ensures equal distribution rights with existing unitholders
- Issue price of Rs. 60 serves as reference point for immediate post-listing valuation

**Trading Members**: Must ensure systems are updated before market opening on October 16, 2025 to facilitate seamless trading of the additional units.
