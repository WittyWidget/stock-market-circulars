## Summary

NSE Clearing has issued instructions for early pay-in of securities for Sigma Solve Limited (SIGMA) undergoing a face value split from Rs 10 per share to Re 1 per share.

- For sale of 10 shares, early pay-in should be 1 share in old ISIN
- Client-wise allocation file should not be uploaded for early pay-in through block mechanism

## Impact Assessment

This circular affects members and custodians handling SIGMA securities during the face value split period. The 1:10 split ratio requires careful attention to early pay-in quantities to ensure proper settlement. Members must adjust their operational processes to use old ISIN before record date and new ISIN afterward. Failure to follow correct procedures could result in settlement failures or margin calculation errors. The requirement affects two settlement cycles and requires coordination between trading members, custodians, and depositories.
