title: Change in scheme name of HDFC Mutual Fund on NSE MF Invest platform
---

## Summary

HDFC Mutual Fund is changing the name of one of its Fund of Fund (FOF) schemes on the NSE MF Invest platform effective August 30, 2025. The change is part of compliance with SEBI's Standardized Framework for Fund of Fund Schemes dated June 30, 2025.

## Key Points

- Scheme name change from "HDFC Developed World Equity Passive FOF" to "HDFC Developed World Overseas Equity Passive FOF"
- Change effective from August 30, 2025
- Part of alignment with SEBI's standardized framework for FOF schemes
- Additional changes include benchmark modifications and eligible underlying schemes list updates for other HDFC FOF schemes

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI's Standardized Framework for Fund of Fund Schemes dated June 30, 2025 requires existing FOF schemes investing in multiple underlying schemes to be aligned and re-categorized as per the new framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE MF Invest platform members are informed of the scheme name change
- Fund house has issued notice cum addendum for the changes
- All FOF schemes with multiple underlying schemes must align with the new framework

## Important Dates

- **August 30, 2025**: Effective date for scheme name change and other FOF scheme modifications

## Impact Assessment

Minimal impact as this is primarily an administrative name change to comply with regulatory framework. Investors in the scheme will see the new name reflected in their statements and platform displays, but the underlying investment strategy and operations remain unchanged.
