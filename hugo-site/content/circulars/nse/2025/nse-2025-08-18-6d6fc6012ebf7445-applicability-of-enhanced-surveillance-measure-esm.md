title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework Updates - Securities Movement
  Between Stages
---

## Summary

NSE has issued updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective August 19-20, 2025. Two securities (MANUGRAPH and UMAEXPORTS) are moving from Stage I to Stage II, while no new securities are being added to Stage I or excluded from the framework. Securities under ESM attract minimum 100% margin and are shifted to Trade-for-Trade segment.

## Key Points

- No new securities added to ESM Stage I
- 2 securities moving from Stage I to Stage II: MANUGRAPH and UMAEXPORTS
- No securities moving from Stage II to Stage I
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- Consolidated list shows at least 4 securities under ESM including ABMINTLLTD, ASLIND, and ASPIRE
- All ESM securities attract minimum 100% margin requirement
- Securities shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade (BE/ST) segment

## Regulatory Changes

- Stage II securities will be under Trade for Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Enhanced surveillance framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against companies

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with 100% margin requirements on all open positions as of August 19, 2025
- New positions created from August 20, 2025 will attract minimum 100% margin
- Trading in affected securities will be restricted to Trade-for-Trade segment

## Important Dates

- **August 19, 2025**: Stage changes become effective; 100% margin applies to existing open positions
- **August 20, 2025**: Securities shift to Trade-for-Trade segment; 100% margin applies to new positions

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on affected securities and their traders. The 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for trading these securities. Movement to Trade-for-Trade segment reduces liquidity and increases settlement obligations. Stage II securities face additional restrictions with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction, further limiting price movement and trading flexibility.
