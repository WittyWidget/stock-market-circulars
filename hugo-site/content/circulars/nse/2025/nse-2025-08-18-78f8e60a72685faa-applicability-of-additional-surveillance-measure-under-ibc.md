title: Additional Surveillance Measure under IBC - Securities Updates
---

## Summary

NSE has issued updates regarding the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) for companies under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The circular announces that Hindusthan National Glass & Industries Limited (HINDNATGLS) will be excluded from the ASM IBC framework effective August 19, 2025. No new securities are being added to any ASM IBC categories.

## Key Points

- One security (HINDNATGLS) excluded from ASM IBC framework
- No new securities added to ASM IBC categories
- ASM IBC framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting under ASM IBC is for market surveillance purposes only
- Current consolidated ASM IBC list includes securities like ARSHIYA, COMPINFO, FLFL, FSC, and GENSOL

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. The circular is a routine update to existing ASM IBC framework established through previous circulars from 2018, 2022, and 2023.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the exclusion of HINDNATGLS from ASM IBC
- Members should be aware that ASM IBC works alongside other prevailing surveillance measures
- No specific compliance actions required beyond noting the changes

## Important Dates

- **August 19, 2025**: Effective date for exclusion of HINDNATGLS from ASM IBC

## Impact Assessment

Low to medium impact circular focusing on administrative updates to surveillance framework. The exclusion of one security from ASM IBC suggests improved compliance or resolution of insolvency-related issues for Hindusthan National Glass & Industries Limited. No broader market disruption expected.
