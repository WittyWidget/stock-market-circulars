## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders and traders of these two specific NCD series. The suspension prevents secondary market trading during the amalgamation process.

**Investor Impact**: NCD holders cannot trade these securities on the exchange until the suspension is lifted post-amalgamation completion. Investors should monitor further circulars regarding the scheme of amalgamation and potential resumption or delisting.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update trading systems to block orders for these ISINs. The suspension is standard procedure during corporate restructuring to protect investor interests and ensure orderly markets during the transition period.
