title: Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - Long Term Framework Changes
---

## Summary

NSE has announced the implementation of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measures (ASM) on select securities effective August 25, 2025. The measure includes a 100% margin requirement on all positions and potential shifts from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment for qualifying securities.

## Key Points

- Long Term ASM framework applied to shortlisted securities
- 100% margin rate applicable on all open and new positions
- Securities meeting Stage IV criteria shifted to Trade-for-Trade segment
- Two securities (SATIPOLY and STALLION) moving from Stage I to Stage II
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of 100% margin requirement under Long Term ASM
- Shift of qualifying securities from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE)
- Enhanced surveillance measures based on predefined criteria

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with 100% margin requirements
- Trading members need to adjust systems for Trade-for-Trade segment operations
- Adherence to all prevailing surveillance measures alongside ASM framework

## Important Dates

- **August 22, 2025**: Reference date for existing open positions
- **August 25, 2025**: Effective date for 100% margin requirement and segment shifts
- **T+3 basis**: Timeline for Trade-for-Trade segment shifts (T being circular issuance date)

## Impact Assessment

- High impact on liquidity for affected securities due to 100% margin requirement
- Operational changes required for securities moving to Trade-for-Trade segment
- Enhanced monitoring and compliance costs for market participants
- Limited immediate impact as most categories show 'Nil' entries, with only two securities (SATIPOLY and STALLION) moving between stages
