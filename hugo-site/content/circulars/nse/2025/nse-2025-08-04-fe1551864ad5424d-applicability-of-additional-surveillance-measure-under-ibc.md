## Summary

NSE has updated the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) list for companies under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) effective August 5, 2025. The main change is the exclusion of Omkar Speciality Chemicals Limited (OMKARCHEM) from ASM measures.

## Key Points

- No new securities added to ASM under IBC
- No securities moved between IBC stages
- Omkar Speciality Chemicals Limited (OMKARCHEM) excluded from ASM
- 18+ companies remain under various IBC surveillance stages
- Consolidated list maintains existing surveillance framework

## Regulatory Changes

- Removal of OMKARCHEM from ASM surveillance measures
- Continuation of existing IBC surveillance framework
- No changes to stage classifications for other securities

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the exclusion of OMKARCHEM from surveillance measures
- Existing surveillance obligations continue for other listed securities
- Companies must comply with disclosure requirements under IBC surveillance

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 5, 2025
- Changes applicable from market opening on the effective date

## Impact Assessment

Positive development for Omkar Speciality Chemicals Limited as removal from ASM reduces trading restrictions. The exclusion suggests improved compliance or resolution of issues that warranted surveillance. Other companies under IBC surveillance continue to face enhanced monitoring and potential trading limitations.
