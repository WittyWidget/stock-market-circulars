title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Movement Between Stages
---

## Summary

NSE implements Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) changes affecting multiple securities with stage transitions, 100% margin requirements, and trading segment shifts. New securities enter ESM Stage I, while existing securities move between stages with varying restrictions effective August 25-26, 2025.

## Key Points

- Securities in ESM Stage I face 100% margin requirements on all positions
- Securities shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST)
- Stage II securities move to Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- ESM framework operates alongside other existing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance, not adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

- **New ESM Stage I Securities**: ABHAPOWER (Abha Power and Steel Limited) and SADBHIN (Sadbhav Infrastructure Project Limited)
- **Stage I to Stage II Movement**: PPAP (PPAP Automotive Limited) and VOLERCAR (Voler Car Limited)
- **Stage II to Stage I Movement**: ABMINTLLTD (ABM International Limited), ASPIRE (Aspire & Innovative Advertising Limited), DHARMAJ (Dharmaj Crop Guard Limited), and DHRUV (Dhruv Consultancy Services Limited)
- Price bands for securities exiting framework will revert to pre-ESM levels unless under other surveillance measures

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain minimum 100% margin for all ESM Stage I securities
- Trading in affected securities restricted to Trade-for-Trade segment
- Stage II securities subject to 2% price band limitation under Periodic Call Auction mechanism
- Members must comply with enhanced monitoring and reporting requirements

## Important Dates

- **August 25, 2025**: Stage II securities move to Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- **August 26, 2025**: 100% margin requirement effective on all open and new positions for Stage I securities
- **August 26, 2025**: Securities shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST segment

## Impact Assessment

- **Trading Impact**: Significant liquidity constraints due to Trade-for-Trade requirements and price band restrictions
- **Capital Impact**: 100% margin requirement substantially increases capital requirements for market participants
- **Market Access**: Reduced accessibility for retail investors due to enhanced trading restrictions
- **Price Discovery**: Limited price movement potential with 2% price band for Stage II securities
- **Operational Impact**: Enhanced monitoring and compliance burden on brokers and market participants
