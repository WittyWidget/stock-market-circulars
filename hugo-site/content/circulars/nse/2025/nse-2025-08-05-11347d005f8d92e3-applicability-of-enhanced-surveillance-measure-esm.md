title: Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - August 2025 Updates
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective August 6-7, 2025. One new security (AGROPHOS) has been added to ESM Stage-I, while three securities (DHARAN, VIJIFIN, VINEETLAB) are moving from Stage-I to Stage-II. No securities are being excluded from the framework.

## Key Points

- AGROPHOS (Agro Phos India Limited) added to ESM Stage-I with 100% margin requirement
- Three securities transitioning from Stage-I to Stage-II under periodic call auction
- Securities under ESM shifted from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment
- Stage-II securities subject to 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Securities qualifying under ESM shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST)
- Stage-II securities placed under Trade for Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Minimum 100% margin applicable on all open and new positions

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with 100% margin requirements for ESM securities
- All open positions as of August 6, 2025 and new positions from August 7, 2025 subject to enhanced margins
- Trading restrictions apply through Trade-for-Trade mechanism

## Important Dates

- **August 6, 2025**: Stage transitions effective, Stage-II securities under Periodic Call Auction
- **August 7, 2025**: Segment shifts from EQ/SM to BE/ST effective, 100% margin requirement starts

## Impact Assessment

**Stage-I Addition:**
- AGROPHOS: Subject to 100% margin and Trade-for-Trade settlement

**Stage-I to Stage-II Transitions:**
- DHARAN (DHARAN INFRA-EPC LIMITED)
- VIJIFIN (Viji Finance Limited)
- VINEETLAB (Vineet Laboratories Limited)

**Current ESM Securities:**
- ABMINTLLTD (ABM International Limited) remains in Stage-II

The measures are implemented for market surveillance purposes and should not be construed as adverse action against the companies. Trading liquidity may be reduced due to Trade-for-Trade settlement and higher margin requirements.
