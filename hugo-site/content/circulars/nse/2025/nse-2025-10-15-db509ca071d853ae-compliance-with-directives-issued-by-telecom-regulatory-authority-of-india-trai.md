## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued a circular directing all clearing members to comply with amendments to the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018 notified by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The amendments aim to strengthen consumer protection against Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC). Clearing members must implement specific technical and operational measures including URL whitelisting, mandatory use of 1600 series numbers for outbound calls, and enhanced internal controls.

## Key Points

- Clearing members must ensure full compliance with amended TCCCPR, 2018
- Complete whitelisting of all URLs, APKs, and similar resources used by clearing members (principal entities) is mandatory
- Outbound service and transactional calls must use 1600 series numbers only
- Normal 10-digit numbers cannot be used for any commercial communications including service and transactional calls
- SIP/PRI connections must be used only in compliance with TCCCPR, 2018
- Full cooperation required with Indian Cybercrime Coordination Centre (I4C) and TRAI for reporting and advisory protocols
- Internal systems and controls must be strengthened to prevent inadvertent or malicious use of registered headers and content templates

## Regulatory Changes

TRAI has notified amendments to the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018 with the objective of strengthening consumer protection against Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC). The detailed regulations are available on TRAI's website at https://www.trai.gov.in/release-publication/regulations.

These amendments impose stricter requirements on how commercial entities can communicate with customers, particularly focusing on preventing spam and unauthorized communications.

## Compliance Requirements

**Mandatory Actions for Clearing Members:**

1. **Whitelisting**: Complete whitelisting of all URLs, APKs, and other digital resources used by the clearing member organization

2. **Telephony Compliance**: 
   - Use only 1600 series numbers for all outbound service and transactional calls
   - Discontinue use of normal 10-digit numbers for commercial communications
   - Ensure SIP/PRI connections comply with TCCCPR, 2018

3. **Cooperation with Authorities**: Provide full cooperation to I4C and TRAI regarding any reporting requirements and advisory protocols

4. **Internal Controls**: Implement robust internal systems and controls to prevent unauthorized use of registered communication headers and content templates

5. **General Compliance**: Ensure comprehensive adherence to all provisions of amended TCCCPR, 2018

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 15, 2025
- **Effective Date**: Immediate compliance required (no specific deadline mentioned, indicating immediate implementation)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium to High - Clearing members need to undertake significant operational changes to their communication infrastructure, including:
- Migrating all customer communication to 1600 series numbers
- Implementing whitelisting processes for digital assets
- Updating internal systems and procedures

**Compliance Risk**: High - Non-compliance with TRAI directives could result in regulatory penalties and disruption of member communication capabilities

**Market Impact**: Low - This circular affects back-office and customer communication operations rather than direct trading or clearing activities

**Technology Requirements**: Medium - Requires technical implementation of whitelisting systems, telephony system changes, and enhanced monitoring controls
