## Impact Assessment

This is a routine ETF listing with minimal market-wide impact. The listing provides investors with a new passive investment vehicle tracking the Nifty 50 index through Zerodha's fund house. The presence of four designated market makers should ensure adequate liquidity. The ETF expands investment options in the index fund category but does not introduce any regulatory changes or compliance burdens for market participants beyond standard ETF trading protocols.
