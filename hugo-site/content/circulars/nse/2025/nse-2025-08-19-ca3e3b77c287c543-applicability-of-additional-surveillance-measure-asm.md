## Summary

NSE has announced changes to securities under the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework effective August 20, 2025. The primary change involves Jeena Sikho Lifecare Limited (JSLL) moving from Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I to Stage-II. Most other categories show no securities being added, moved, or excluded from the ASM framework.

## Key Points

- Only one security (JSLL) is being moved between ASM stages
- No new securities are being added to Stage-I or Stage-IV of the ASM framework
- No securities are being excluded from the ASM framework
- The consolidated ASM list shows multiple securities across different stages, with Stage-I having the most listings
- Securities in Stage-IV under Criteria VII are shifted to Trade for Trade (Series: BE) on T+3 basis

## Regulatory Changes

- Movement of JSLL from ASM Stage-I to Stage-II increases surveillance measures on the security
- Securities reaching Stage-IV under specific criteria face trading restrictions (Trade for Trade settlement)

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with enhanced surveillance measures for securities in higher ASM stages
- Securities in Stage-IV under Criteria VII must be traded on a Trade for Trade basis
- All changes take effect from August 20, 2025

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 20, 2025 - All ASM framework changes become applicable
- **T+3 Settlement**: Securities moved to Stage-IV under Criteria VII shift to Trade for Trade settlement three days after circular issuance

## Impact Assessment

- **Trading Impact**: JSLL faces increased surveillance measures which may affect liquidity and trading patterns
- **Market Operations**: Minimal overall impact as only one security is being moved between stages
- **Investor Awareness**: Enhanced monitoring requirements for JSLL may lead to increased scrutiny from market participants
- **Settlement Impact**: Securities in Stage-IV continue to face Trade for Trade settlement restrictions
