## Summary

NSE has updated the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective October 24, 2025. Eight securities have been added to ST-ASM Stage-I, while eight securities are being excluded from the ASM framework entirely. No securities are being added to Stage-II or moving between stages. The consolidated ASM list now contains 23 securities in Stage-I.

## Key Points

- 8 securities added to Short-Term ASM Framework Stage-I: GFL Limited, GK Energy Limited, Lexus Granito (India) Limited, Mcon Rasayan India Limited, Mahendra Realtors & Infrastructure Limited, Pratham EPC Projects Limited, Tatva Chintan Pharma Chem Limited, and Vijaypd Ceutical Limited
- No securities added to Stage-II
- No securities moving between Stage-I and Stage-II
- 8 securities excluded from ASM Framework: Capital Trust Limited, Jindal Photo Limited, Jyoti Global Plast Limited, Knowledge Marine & Engineering Works Limited, Niraj Cement Structurals Limited, Sameera Agro And Infra Limited, TVS Electronics Limited, and V Marc India Limited
- Consolidated ASM list shows 23 securities currently in Stage-I

## Regulatory Changes

The Short-Term ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities exhibiting unusual price movements or volatility patterns. Securities in this framework face additional trading restrictions and margin requirements to protect investor interests and maintain market stability.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced margin requirements for securities under ST-ASM Stage-I
- Price bands and trade-to-trade settlement apply to affected securities
- Market participants must review their positions in the affected securities and ensure adequate margin coverage

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 24, 2025 - Changes to ST-ASM framework come into effect

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 8 securities to ST-ASM Stage-I will result in stricter trading conditions including higher margins and potential price bands, which may reduce liquidity and increase trading costs for these stocks. Conversely, the removal of 8 securities from the ASM framework signals improved compliance and stability, allowing normal trading conditions to resume. Investors and traders dealing with these 16 securities should adjust their strategies accordingly.
