---

## Summary

DSP Mutual Fund is changing the names of seven Fund of Fund (FOF) schemes effective August 31, 2025, in compliance with SEBI's Standardized Framework for Fund of Fund Schemes. The changes involve rebranding existing schemes with more descriptive names that better reflect their investment strategies.

## Key Points

- Seven DSP Mutual Fund FOF schemes will have new names from August 31, 2025
- Changes are mandated by SEBI's standardized framework for FOF schemes
- DSP Income Plus Arbitrage Fund will also have its benchmark revised
- All scheme functionalities remain unchanged, only names are being modified
- Notice cum addendum has been issued to update Scheme Information Documents

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of SEBI's Standardized Framework for Fund of Fund Schemes
- Mandatory name standardization for FOF schemes to improve clarity
- Benchmark change for DSP Income Plus Arbitrage Fund from CRISIL Dynamic Bond A-III Index to NIFTY Composite Debt Index

## Compliance Requirements

- AMC to update all scheme documentation including SID and KIM
- Members on NSE MF Invest platform to note the name changes
- Investors advised to update PAN, KYC, email, mobile number, and nominee details
- Unit holders should link PAN with Aadhaar numbers

## Important Dates

- **August 31, 2025**: Effective date for all scheme name changes
- **August 22, 2025**: Date of DSP Mutual Fund's notice cum addendum
- **June 30, 2025**: SEBI communication date regarding standardized framework

## Impact Assessment

The changes are primarily administrative and cosmetic, aimed at bringing uniformity to FOF scheme naming conventions. Investors will need to familiarize themselves with new scheme names but investment objectives and strategies remain unchanged. The benchmark change for one scheme may result in slight performance tracking differences but overall impact on investment returns is expected to be minimal.
