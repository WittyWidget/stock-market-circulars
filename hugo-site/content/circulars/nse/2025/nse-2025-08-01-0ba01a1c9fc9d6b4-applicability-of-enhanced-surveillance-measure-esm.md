title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Movement and New Inclusions
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework with securities movements between stages. ASL Industries Limited moves from Stage I to Stage II, while nine securities move from Stage II to Stage I. Securities under ESM attract minimum 100% margin and shift to Trade-for-Trade segment.

## Key Points

- No new securities added to ESM Stage I
- ASL Industries Limited (ASLIND) moves to ESM Stage II with Trade-for-Trade and 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Nine securities move from Stage II to Stage I with reduced restrictions
- All ESM securities shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST)
- Minimum 100% margin applies to all open and new positions

## Regulatory Changes

- Securities in Stage II will trade under Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band
- Trade-for-Trade settlement mandatory for all ESM securities
- Price bands will be reinstated to pre-ESM levels when securities exit the framework
- ESM operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure 100% margin for ESM securities
- All ESM securities must be traded in Trade-for-Trade segment
- Stage II securities subject to Periodic Call Auction restrictions
- Market participants should monitor consolidated ESM list (Annexure III)

## Important Dates

- **August 4, 2025**: Stage movements effective, Stage II securities under Periodic Call Auction
- **August 5, 2025**: 100% margin requirement and Trade-for-Trade segment shift effective

## Impact Assessment

**Moving to Stage II (Higher Restrictions):**
- ASLIND: ASL Industries Limited - faces stricter trading conditions with Periodic Call Auction

**Moving to Stage I (Reduced Restrictions):**
- AAREYDRUGS: Aarey Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Limited
- BROOKS: Brooks Laboratories Limited
- CREATIVEYE: Creative Eye Limited
- HECPROJECT: HEC Infra Projects Limited
- HYBRIDFIN: Hybrid Financial Services Limited
- KAYA: Kaya Limited
- MACPOWER: Macpower CNC Machines Limited
- MAL: Mangalam Alloys Limited
- PURPLEUTED: Purple United Sales Limited

The framework is a market surveillance tool and not an adverse action against companies. Investors should expect reduced liquidity and higher margin requirements for affected securities.
