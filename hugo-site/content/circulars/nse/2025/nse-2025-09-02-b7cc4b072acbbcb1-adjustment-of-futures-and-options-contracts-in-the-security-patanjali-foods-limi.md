title: Adjustment of Futures and Options Contracts in PATANJALI FOODS LIMITED due
  to 2:1 Bonus Issue
---

## Summary

NSE Clearing has announced adjustment procedures for all Futures and Options contracts in PATANJALI FOODS LIMITED due to a 2:1 bonus issue. The adjustment factor of 3 will be applied to all open positions, with the ex-date set for September 11, 2025. All existing positions will be automatically adjusted including position quantities, strike prices, and market lots.

## Key Points

- Bonus issue ratio: 2:1 (2 bonus shares for every 1 share held)
- Adjustment factor: 3
- Ex-date for corporate action: September 11, 2025
- All open F&O positions as of September 10, 2025 end-of-day will be adjusted
- Futures positions will be multiplied by adjusted market lot
- Futures prices will be divided by adjustment factor (3)
- Options strike prices will be divided by adjustment factor (3)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes announced. Adjustments follow existing SEBI circular SMDRP/DC/CIR-8/01 dated June 21, 2001, and NSE Clearing Byelaws pertaining to clearing and settlement of deals.

## Compliance Requirements

- All clearing members must ensure their systems are updated to reflect adjusted positions
- Trading members need to communicate adjusted positions to clients
- Mark-to-market settlements on September 10, 2025 based on daily settlement price
- Begin-of-day margins on September 11, 2025 to be computed based on adjusted carry forward value
- Intra-day margins to be calculated based on traded prices post-adjustment

## Important Dates

- September 10, 2025: Last trading day with pre-adjusted contracts
- September 10, 2025: End-of-day positions to be marked-to-market
- September 11, 2025: Ex-date for bonus issue and adjusted contracts begin trading
- September 11, 2025 onwards: Normal daily mark-to-market procedures resume

## Impact Assessment

High market impact as all existing F&O positions in PATANJALI FOODS LIMITED will undergo mandatory adjustment. Traders holding positions will see their contract quantities triple (300 contracts become 900) while prices and strike prices reduce to one-third. This ensures economic value remains unchanged while accounting for the bonus shares. Risk management systems and trading strategies may need recalibration to account for the adjusted parameters.
