title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure under IBC

## Summary

NSE has updated the list of securities under Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) for companies subject to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) proceedings. Four securities have been added to Stage I ASM effective October 10, 2025: Eastern Silk Industries Limited, Jaiprakash Associates Limited, Ujaas Energy Limited, and Indosolar Limited. The consolidated list now contains 8 securities in Stage I and 9 securities at the 'Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure' stage.

## Key Points

- Four securities newly added to ASM IBC Stage I: EASTSILK, JPASSOCIAT, UEL, and WAAREEINDO
- Total 8 securities currently in Stage I ASM under IBC framework
- No securities moved between stages (Stage I to II or Stage II to I)
- No securities excluded from ASM framework in this update
- 9 additional securities remain at 'Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure' stage
- Surveillance measures apply to companies undergoing insolvency proceedings

## Regulatory Changes

The ASM framework for IBC applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities of companies undergoing insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings. Securities in Stage I typically face:

- Trade-for-trade (T+T) settlement with no intraday netting
- 5% price band restrictions (both upper and lower circuit)
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- Additional disclosure requirements from companies

The framework has multiple stages with progressively stringent measures based on the IBC proceedings status.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 100% upfront margin collection for transactions in listed securities
- Companies under IBC proceedings must provide timely disclosures about insolvency status
- Investors trading in these securities must be aware of T+T settlement requirements
- No intraday squaring off permitted for Stage I securities
- Brokers must inform clients about ASM applicability before accepting orders

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 10, 2025 - New securities enter Stage I ASM framework
- **Circular Date:** October 9, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - The addition of four securities to Stage I ASM significantly restricts trading liquidity in these stocks. The T+T settlement requirement and price bands will reduce speculative trading and increase cost of transactions due to full margin requirements.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading these securities face reduced liquidity, mandatory delivery-based trading, and potential difficulty in exiting positions. The 5% price band limits daily price movement, which may extend the time needed to liquidate positions.

**Affected Companies:**
- Eastern Silk Industries Limited (EASTSILK) - INE962C01035
- Jaiprakash Associates Limited (JPASSOCIAT) - INE455F01025
- Ujaas Energy Limited (UEL) - INE899L01030
- Indosolar Limited (WAAREEINDO) - INE866K01023

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update surveillance lists, modify margin collection systems, and ensure proper client communication about trading restrictions. Risk management systems need recalibration for these securities.
