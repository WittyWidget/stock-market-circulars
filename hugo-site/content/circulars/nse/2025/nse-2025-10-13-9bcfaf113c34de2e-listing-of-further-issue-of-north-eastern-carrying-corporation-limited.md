## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The conversion of partly paid-up shares to fully paid-up shares represents completion of payment obligations by existing shareholders rather than fresh capital raising or change in shareholding structure. The relatively small number of shares (90,149) limits any potential price or liquidity impact. The shares will rank pari passu with existing equity shares and have no lock-in restrictions, allowing normal trading.
