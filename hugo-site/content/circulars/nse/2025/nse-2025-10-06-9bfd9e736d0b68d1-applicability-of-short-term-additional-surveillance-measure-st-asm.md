## Summary

NSE has updated the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective October 07, 2025. Four securities have been added to Stage I of the ST-ASM framework, while six securities are being excluded from the ASM framework altogether. No securities are moving between stages or entering Stage II.

## Key Points

- 4 securities added to ST-ASM Stage I: AAA Technologies Limited, Delaplex Limited, Manav Infra Projects Limited, and United Heat Transfer Limited
- 6 securities excluded from ASM framework: Cybertech Systems And Software Limited, Giriraj Civil Developers Limited, HVAX Technologies Limited, Sharp Chucks and Machines Limited, Sikko Industries Limited, and Taurian MPS Limited
- No securities currently in ST-ASM Stage II
- No securities moving between Stage I and Stage II
- Sikko Industries moved from ST-ASM to LT-ASM framework
- Cybertech Systems and Taurian MPS moved from ST-ASM to ESM framework
- Consolidated ASM list contains 26+ securities across various stages

## Regulatory Changes

The Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework continues to be applied to identify and monitor securities with abnormal price movements or trading patterns. The framework operates in two stages with progressively stricter surveillance measures.

## Compliance Requirements

Securities placed under ST-ASM Stage I are subject to additional surveillance measures including:
- Enhanced monitoring of trading activity
- Possible trade-to-trade settlement
- Additional margin requirements
- Price bands or other trading restrictions as applicable

Market participants trading in these securities must comply with the enhanced surveillance requirements.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 07, 2025 - ST-ASM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Securities Entering ST-ASM Stage I:**
- AAATECH (AAA Technologies Limited) - INE0D0U01013
- DELAPLEX (Delaplex Limited) - INE0SK801018
- MANAV (Manav Infra Projects Limited) - INE104Y01012
- UHTL (United Heat Transfer Limited) - INE0SMR01011

These securities will face increased trading restrictions and scrutiny, potentially impacting liquidity and trading volumes.

**Securities Exiting ASM Framework:**
- CYBERTECH, GIRIRAJ, HVAX, SCML - Complete exit or movement to other surveillance frameworks
- SIKKO - Moved to Long-Term ASM (LT-ASM) framework
- TAURIAN, CYBERTECH - Moved to Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework

The exit of 6 securities indicates improved compliance or migration to appropriate surveillance categories. The consolidated ASM list maintains comprehensive coverage with 26+ securities under various stages of surveillance.
