The new limits are categorized based on member type and net worth, with Professional Clearing Members (PCMs), custodians, and Trading Cum Clearing Members having higher limits based on their net worth thresholds.

## Key Points

- Limits differentiated based on member category and net worth (above/below Rs.500 crores)
- Separate limits for clearing banks vs other banks
- Members advised to check applicable limits before bank guarantee issuance

## Regulatory Changes

**Member-wise Bank-wise Limits (Rs in Crores):**
- PCM/Custodian/TM-CM with net worth ≥Rs.500 crores: Clearing Bank 3500, Other Banks 2800
- PCM/Custodian/TM-CM with net worth <Rs.500 crores: Clearing Bank 1750, Other Banks 1400
- Other categories: Clearing Bank 350, Other Banks 280

**Member-wise Total Limits across all segments (Rs in Crores):**

## Impact Assessment

This revision provides clearer tiered limits based on member net worth, potentially allowing larger clearing members with higher net worth to utilize more bank guarantee facilities. The differentiation between clearing banks and other banks also provides operational flexibility in collateral management.
