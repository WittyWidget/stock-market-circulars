## Summary

NSE has announced a change in ISIN code for Tata Investment Corporation Limited (TATAINVEST) effective October 14, 2025. The change is due to a sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/-. The new ISIN INE672A01026 will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date.

## Key Points

- Company: Tata Investment Corporation Limited
- Symbol: TATAINVEST
- New ISIN: INE672A01026
- Reason: Sub-division of face value from Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/-
- Effective date: October 14, 2025 (ex-date)
- New ISIN applicable for all trades from ex-date onwards

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a routine ISIN code change following corporate action of face value sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must update their systems with the new ISIN code INE672A01026
- All trades executed on or after October 14, 2025 must use the new ISIN
- Settlement and custody systems must be updated before the ex-date

## Important Dates

- **October 06, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 14, 2025**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on trading members and back-office systems. The face value sub-division from Rs. 10 to Re. 1 (10:1 split) will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while proportionately reducing the price per share. Members need to ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN before the ex-date to avoid settlement issues. This is a standard corporate action that requires system updates but does not change the fundamental value of holdings.
