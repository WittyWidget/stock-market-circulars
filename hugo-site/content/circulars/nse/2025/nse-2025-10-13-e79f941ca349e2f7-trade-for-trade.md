## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Significant liquidity reduction as netting off is prohibited
- Trading volume likely to decrease due to 5% price band restriction
- Intraday trading strategies become non-viable for these securities
- Increased capital requirement as each trade requires separate settlement

**Operational Impact:**
- Members must ensure adequate securities/funds for each individual trade
- Settlement cycles become more stringent with T+T mechanism
- Position management becomes more complex without netting capability
- Increased operational burden on clearing and settlement systems

**Investor Impact:**
- Higher transaction costs due to inability to net positions
- Limited price discovery due to restrictive 5% band
- Reduced liquidity may widen bid-ask spreads
- Entry and exit from positions becomes more capital intensive

**Surveillance Rationale:**
The exchange clarifies this is purely a market surveillance action and should not be construed as adverse action against the concerned companies. The criteria indicate concerns about price volatility, earnings multiples, and market capitalization metrics triggering enhanced monitoring through Trade for Trade mechanism.
