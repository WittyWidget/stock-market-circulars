## Summary

SEBI has provided partial relief to Rajiv Kapoor (PAN: ARSPK9663Q) in connection with the enforcement action related to recommendations given by Sanjiv Bhasin in media channels and social media platforms. After Kapoor complied with the impounding directions under Para 149(i) of the SEBI order, several restrictions have been lifted, though he must still comply with Para 149(x).

## Key Points

- SEBI has lifted restrictions under clauses (ii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii) of the original order
- Kapoor must still comply with directions under Para 149(x) of the SEBI order
- This relates to the broader enforcement action against Sanjiv Bhasin's media recommendations

## Regulatory Changes

Partial modification of existing SEBI enforcement order - certain trading and dealing restrictions have been lifted for Rajiv Kapoor following his compliance with impounding requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Rajiv Kapoor must continue to comply with Para 149(x) of the SEBI order

- Members should refer to the consolidated list of debarred entities on NSE website

## Important Dates
