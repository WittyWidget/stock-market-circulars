## Summary

NSE has decided to cancel the planned suspension of trading in Shree Ram Proteins Limited (SRPL) securities, which was originally scheduled due to non-compliance with board composition requirements under SEBI Listing Regulations.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension for SRPL securities has been cancelled effective August 28, 2025
- Original suspension was planned due to non-compliance with Regulation 17(1) regarding board composition
- Non-compliance occurred for two consecutive quarters: December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025
- This reverses the decision announced in earlier circular 1371/2025 dated July 28, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes - this is a reversal of a previously announced enforcement action.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements specified. The cancellation suggests SRPL may have addressed the board composition issues.

## Important Dates

- **August 28, 2025**: Effective date for cancellation of trading suspension
- **July 28, 2025**: Date of original suspension announcement (Circular 1371/2025)
- **December 31, 2024 & March 31, 2025**: Quarters during which non-compliance occurred

## Impact Assessment

Positive impact for SRPL shareholders and investors as normal trading operations will continue without interruption. The cancellation indicates the company likely resolved its board composition compliance issues.
