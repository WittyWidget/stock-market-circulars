title: Password Encryption for New Debt Market (NDM) Segment - Mandatory Password
  Reset
---

## Summary

NSE is implementing enhanced security measures for the New Debt Market (NDM) Segment to reinforce security and improve cyber resilience. All users must perform a mandatory one-time password reset after business hours on October 31, 2025. Users will be prompted to reset passwords upon next login after validation of existing credentials, and access will only be granted after successful password reset.

## Key Points

- Mandatory one-time password reset required for all NDM Segment users
- Implementation scheduled post business hours on October 31, 2025
- Users must reset password upon next login after existing credential validation
- Application access will be blocked until password reset is completed
- Enhanced security measure to improve cyber resilience of NDM system

## Regulatory Changes

NSE is introducing enhanced password encryption and security protocols for the New Debt Market (NDM) Segment application. This represents a system-wide security upgrade affecting all market participants in the debt segment.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NDM Segment users must mandatorily reset their passwords after October 31, 2025
- Password reset must be completed upon first login attempt after the implementation date
- Existing credentials will be validated before password reset prompt appears
- Failure to reset password will result in inability to access the application
- Market participants should ensure all users are aware of this requirement to avoid login issues

## Important Dates

- **October 28, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 31, 2025**: Password reset implementation after business hours
- **Post October 31, 2025**: Mandatory password reset required for all subsequent logins

## Impact Assessment

This circular has high operational impact as it affects all users of the NDM Segment. Market participants must ensure timely compliance to avoid disruption in debt market trading activities. The mandatory nature of the password reset means that failure to comply will result in complete loss of system access until the password is reset. Debt market operations could be affected if users are not prepared for the password reset requirement. The measure enhances overall market security and cyber resilience but requires coordinated action from all participants to ensure smooth transition.
