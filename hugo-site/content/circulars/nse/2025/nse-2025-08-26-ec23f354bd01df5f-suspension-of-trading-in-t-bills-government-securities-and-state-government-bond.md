## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects debt market liquidity as multiple government securities become untradeable. However, this is routine market activity due to natural redemption cycle.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium - market participants need to adjust portfolios and trading strategies around these suspensions, but such events are planned and expected in government securities trading.

**Investor Impact**: Low - investors holding these securities will receive redemption proceeds as per terms, while those looking to trade will need alternative instruments.
