  2025 Updates
---

## Summary

NSE has updated its surveillance measure for companies with high promoter and non-promoter encumbrance under SEBI (SAST) Regulation 2011. Two companies are being removed from the framework while the consolidated list maintains four securities subject to 75% minimum margin requirements.

## Key Points

- No new securities added to the surveillance framework in this update
- Two companies excluded from the measure effective September 1, 2025
- Consolidated framework now includes 4 securities with 75% margin requirement
- Measure applies to both equity and equity derivatives segments
- Framework subject to periodic review

## Regulatory Changes

- Removal of Indo Tech Transformers Limited (INDOTECH) from surveillance measure
- Removal of Steel Exchange India Limited (STEELXIND) from surveillance measure
- No changes to margin requirements for remaining securities under the framework

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 75% minimum margin on all open positions for securities under the framework
- Margin requirements apply to positions as of September 2, 2025 and new positions from September 3, 2025
- Framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing exchange measures

## Important Dates

- **September 1, 2025**: Effective date for exclusion of INDOTECH and STEELXIND
- **September 2, 2025**: Cut-off date for existing open positions subject to margin requirements
- **September 3, 2025**: Effective date for margin requirements on new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact**: Reduced surveillance burden for Indo Tech Transformers Limited and Steel Exchange India Limited, potentially improving trading flexibility and reducing margin costs for these securities.

**Ongoing Impact**: Four securities (FMNL, HINDNATGLS, TFCILTD, THYROCARE) remain under enhanced surveillance with 75% margin requirements, continuing to face higher capital requirements for trading positions.
