## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing circular with moderate market impact. The additional shares increase the float for these companies, with Bohra Industries having the largest addition of 6.87 million shares. ESOP allotments typically have minimal immediate market impact, while the preferential allotment for Bohra Industries represents more significant dilution but comes with lock-in restrictions.
