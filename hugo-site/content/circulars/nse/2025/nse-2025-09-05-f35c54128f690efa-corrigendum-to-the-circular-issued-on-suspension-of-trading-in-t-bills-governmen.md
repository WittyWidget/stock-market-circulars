## Key Points

- Corrigendum to earlier circular NSE/CML/69866 dated August 26, 2025

- All suspensions effective from September 8, 2025
- Suspensions are due to redemption of the securities

## Securities Affected

| Symbol | Series | ISIN | Suspension Date | Reason |
|--------|--------|------|-----------------|--------|
| 91D110925 | TB | IN002025X117 | 08-Sep-25 | Redemption |
| 182D110925 | TB | IN002024Y480 | 08-Sep-25 | Redemption |
| 364D110925 | TB | IN002024Z248 | 08-Sep-25 | Redemption |

## Important Dates

- **Suspension Date**: September 8, 2025 - Trading suspended for all three treasury bills
- **Reference Circular Date**: August 26, 2025 (NSE/CML/69866)
- **Clearing Corporation Circular**: September 4, 2025 (NCL/CMPT/70039)

## Impact Assessment

The suspension affects three government treasury bills with different maturity periods (91-day, 182-day, and 364-day). This is a routine administrative action due to the natural redemption cycle of these securities and should have minimal market disruption as it follows the predetermined maturity schedule.
