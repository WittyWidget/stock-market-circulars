title: Introduction of Bulk Authorised Person Cancellation Request Facility
---

## Summary

NSE has launched a new facility enabling members to bulk cancel Authorised Person (AP) registrations through the ENIT Portal. This functionality allows members to upload multiple AP cancellation requests simultaneously via ENIT→Compliance→Authorised Person→Applications→Cancellation Bulk Request. The facility is available for all AP cancellations except those on disciplinary grounds, and submitted requests will be automatically processed without modification options.

## Key Points

- Bulk cancellation facility now available through ENIT Portal for Authorised Persons
- Access path: ENIT→Compliance→Authorised Person→Applications→Cancellation Bulk Request
- Functionality available for AP cancellations on any reason except disciplinary grounds
- User manual provided in Annexure A with step-by-step guidance
- Automatic processing upon submission - no modifications allowed after submission
- Template file naming convention: <MemCode>_APCANCELLATION_<DDMMYYYY>
- Documents must be saved with AP PAN number in ZIP folder named <Member Code>
- Response file generated for review and corrections if needed

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a procedural enhancement to existing AP management processes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure correctness of AP details before uploading (AP PAN, segments, reason for cancellation)
- Select cancellation reasons only from dropdown provided in template
- Save supporting documents with AP PAN number
- Create ZIP folder with member code for document upload
- Accept all terms and conditions via declaration box before submission
- Review response file for remarks and re-upload corrected file if required
- No application will be created until success file is generated

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 10, 2025 (circular date - facility launched)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Positive - significantly improves operational efficiency for members managing multiple Authorised Persons by enabling bulk processing instead of individual cancellation requests.

**Member Impact**: Medium - streamlines compliance workflows and reduces administrative burden for brokers with large AP networks. Time savings in processing multiple cancellations simultaneously.

**Support**: Helpdesk available at 1800 266 0050 (IVR option 3) or memcompliance_support@nse.co.in for assistance.
