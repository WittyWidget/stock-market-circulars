## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative circular with minimal market impact. The listing of further issues represents normal corporate actions (ESOP exercises and release of bonus shares from abeyance). The volumes are relatively small compared to the free float of these companies. No changes to trading regulations, compliance requirements, or market operations are involved. Investors should note the increased share count for dilution calculations, though the impact is marginal for most companies listed.
