title: Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Implementation
---

## Summary

NSE has implemented Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I on three securities effective August 8, 2025, requiring 50% margin or existing margin (whichever is higher) capped at 100%. Additionally, three securities are being excluded from the ASM framework.

## Key Points

- Three securities included in ST-ASM Stage I: Essen Speciality Films Limited (ESFL), Jainam Ferro Alloys (I) Limited (JAINAM), and Zim Laboratories Limited (ZIMLAB)
- Margin requirement increased to 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher, subject to maximum 100%
- Three securities excluded from ASM framework: Brightcom Group Limited (BCG), Jaiprakash Power Ventures Limited (JPPOWER), and Prime Focus Limited (PFOCUS)
- No securities moved between ST-ASM stages
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of ST-ASM Stage I with enhanced margin requirements for identified securities based on market surveillance criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure compliance with 50% minimum margin requirements for ST-ASM Stage I securities
- Margin requirements apply to all open positions as on August 7, 2025, and new positions from August 8, 2025
- Members must adhere to all prevailing surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **August 7, 2025**: Reference date for existing open positions
- **August 8, 2025**: Effective date for ST-ASM Stage I implementation and exclusions from ASM framework

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on affected securities and their investors due to increased margin requirements. The measure is purely surveillance-based and should not be construed as adverse action against companies. Limited market-wide impact as only specific securities are affected.
