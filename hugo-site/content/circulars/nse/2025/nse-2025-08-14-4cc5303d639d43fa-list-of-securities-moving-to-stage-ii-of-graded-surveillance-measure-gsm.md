NSE has announced that Gayatri Projects Limited (GAYAPROJ) will be moved to Stage II of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective August 18, 2025. This move implements stricter trading restrictions including trade-for-trade settlement and additional surveillance deposit requirements.

## Key Points

- Gayatri Projects Limited (Symbol: GAYAPROJ, ISIN: INE336H01023) moves to GSM Stage II
- Trading will be on trade-for-trade basis with 5% or lower price band
- Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) of 50% of trade value required from buyers
- No netting off allowed in settlement
- Members advised to take adequate precautions while trading

## Regulatory Changes

The security will be subject to Stage II GSM surveillance actions:
- Trade for Trade settlement mechanism
- Price band restriction of 5% or lower
- Additional Surveillance Deposit of 50% of trade value to be deposited by buyers
- No netting off permitted in settlement

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must ensure buyers deposit ASD of 50% of trade value
- Members must take adequate precautions while trading in the security
- Settlement will be done on trade-to-trade basis only
- Price band limitations must be observed

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The move to GSM Stage II significantly restricts trading flexibility for Gayatri Projects Limited. The trade-for-trade settlement eliminates netting benefits, while the 50% ASD requirement increases capital requirements for buyers. These measures are designed to curb excessive speculation and ensure more cautious trading behavior. Investors and traders should expect reduced liquidity and higher transaction costs for this security.
