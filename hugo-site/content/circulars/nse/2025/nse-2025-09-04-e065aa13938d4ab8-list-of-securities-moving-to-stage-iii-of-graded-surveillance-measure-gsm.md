## Summary

NSE has moved YAARI Digital Integrated Services Limited (ISIN: INE126M01010) to Stage III of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective September 5, 2025. This stage imposes the most restrictive trading conditions including trade-for-trade settlement, weekly trading limits, 5% price band, and 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit requirement for buyers.

## Key Points

- YAARI Digital Integrated Services Limited moved to Stage III GSM
- Effective date: September 5, 2025
- Trading restricted to once per week (every Monday or first trading day)
- Trade-for-trade settlement with no netting off allowed
- Price band limited to 5% or lower
- 100% Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD) required from buyers
- Settlement on trade-to-trade basis only

## Regulatory Changes

The security will be subject to Stage III GSM surveillance actions, which represent the second-highest level of trading restrictions in the four-stage GSM framework. Members must exercise adequate precaution when trading in this security.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure trade-for-trade settlement procedures
- Buyers must deposit 100% ASD of trade value
- No netting off of positions allowed
- Trading permitted only on designated weekly trading days
- Adherence to 5% or lower price band restrictions

## Important Dates

- **September 5, 2025**: Stage III GSM measures become effective for YAARI

## Impact Assessment

The move to Stage III GSM significantly restricts trading liquidity and frequency for YAARI shares. The weekly trading limitation combined with 100% ASD requirement will likely reduce trading volumes and increase costs for investors. This measure aims to curb excessive speculation and volatility in the security while maintaining orderly market conditions.
