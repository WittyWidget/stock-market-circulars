**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive twice the number of shares at half the price, maintaining their overall investment value. The split does not affect the fundamental value or market capitalization of the company.

**Operational Impact**: Stock exchanges, brokers, and depositories need to update their systems to reflect the new face value and adjusted share count.
