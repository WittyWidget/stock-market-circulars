title: Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - September 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has implemented Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) on select securities effective September 4-5, 2025. Three securities will be newly included in ESM Stage-I with 100% margin requirements and shift from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade segment. One security will move from Stage-I to Stage-II under periodic call auction with 2% price band.

## Key Points

- Three new securities added to ESM Stage-I: AGNI (Agni Green Power Limited), KAUSHALYA (Kaushalya Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited), and SRD (Shankar Lal Rampal Dye-Chem Limited)
- SADHNANIQ (Sadhana Nitrochem Limited) moves from ESM Stage-I to Stage-II
- 100% margin requirement applies to all open and new positions
- Securities shift from EQ/SM series to BE/ST series (trade-for-trade)
- Stage-II securities operate under periodic call auction with 2% price band
- No securities excluded from ESM framework in this update

## Regulatory Changes

- Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework continues with stricter monitoring
- Trade-for-trade settlement replaces rolling settlement for affected securities
- Periodic call auction mechanism for Stage-II securities
- Integration with other prevailing surveillance measures

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain 100% margin for affected securities
- Trading restricted to trade-for-trade segment for newly included securities
- Compliance with periodic call auction rules for Stage-II securities
- Adherence to 2% price band limits for Stage-II trading

## Important Dates

- **September 4, 2025**: ESM Stage changes become effective, Stage-II securities under periodic call auction
- **September 5, 2025**: New Stage-I securities attract 100% margin, shift to trade-for-trade segment

## Impact Assessment

- **Trading Impact**: Significant liquidity constraints due to trade-for-trade settlement and 100% margin requirements
- **Market Participants**: Increased capital requirements and reduced trading flexibility
- **Price Discovery**: Limited price movement in Stage-II securities due to 2% price band and periodic call auction
- **Investor Behavior**: Likely reduced retail participation due to higher margin requirements and settlement restrictions
