## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. These are routine ESOP allotments representing relatively small percentages of total outstanding shares for most companies. The largest allotment mentioned is 625,000 shares for DiGiSPICE Technologies.

**Trading Impact**: Shares are immediately tradeable with no lock-in restrictions, allowing ESOP recipients to liquidate positions if desired. However, given the small quantities, significant market impact is unlikely.

**Dilution Impact**: Marginal dilution to existing shareholders as these represent incremental shares issued under pre-approved ESOP schemes.

**Investor Consideration**: No action required for existing investors. Minor increase in share float may provide modest liquidity benefits.
