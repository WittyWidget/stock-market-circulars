title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Addition and Stage Changes
---

## Summary

NSE has implemented Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) changes affecting 5 securities. Three securities (IZMO, NEPHROCARE, OSWALSEEDS) are being added to ESM Stage-I with 100% margin requirements, while two securities (AGSTRA, ORTINGLOBE) are being moved from Stage-I to Stage-II with stricter trade-for-trade restrictions and 2% price bands under Periodic Call Auction.

## Key Points

- 3 securities added to ESM Stage-I with minimum 100% margin requirement
- Securities will shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade (BE/ST) segment
- 2 securities moved from ESM Stage-I to Stage-II with additional restrictions
- Stage-II securities will have Trade for Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- No securities are being excluded from ESM framework
- ESM framework works in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Securities under ESM Stage-I will attract minimum 100% margin on all positions
- Shift from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST)
- Stage-II securities will operate under Trade for Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Enhanced surveillance purely for market surveillance purposes, not adverse action against companies

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain 100% margin for ESM Stage-I securities
- All open positions as on August 28, 2025, and new positions from August 29, 2025, subject to enhanced margin requirements
- Trading members must comply with Trade-for-Trade settlement for affected securities
- Stage-II securities subject to Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band restrictions

## Important Dates

- **August 28, 2025**: Stage-II securities move to Trade for Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- **August 29, 2025**: ESM Stage-I securities shift to Trade-for-Trade segment and 100% margin requirement takes effect

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact**: The implementation of 100% margin requirements and shift to Trade-for-Trade settlement significantly restricts trading flexibility and increases capital requirements for market participants. Stage-II restrictions with 2% price bands and Periodic Call Auction further limit trading opportunities and price discovery mechanisms for affected securities.
