title: Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) - Stage I Implementation
  for 4 Securities
---

## Summary

NSE has imposed Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I on 4 securities effective August 14, 2025, requiring increased margin rates of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher, capped at 100%) from August 18, 2025. Additionally, 4 securities are being excluded from the ASM framework.

## Key Points

- 4 securities added to ST-ASM Stage I: C2C Advanced Systems Limited, Divine Hira Jewellers Limited, NDL Ventures Limited, and Yatra Online Limited
- Margin requirement increases to 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%
- 4 securities excluded from ASM framework: Netweb Technologies India Limited, Saurashtra Cement Limited, Upsurge Seeds Of Agriculture Limited, and Vipul Limited
- No securities moved between ST-ASM stages
- Surveillance action is market-based and should not be construed as adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of ST-ASM Stage I surveillance measures with enhanced margin requirements for identified securities based on market surveillance criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must apply 50% margin rate or existing margin (whichever is higher) for the 4 listed securities
- Maximum margin rate capped at 100%
- Applies to all open positions as on August 14, 2025 and new positions from August 18, 2025
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **August 14, 2025**: Effective date for securities inclusion/exclusion from ASM framework
- **August 18, 2025**: Enhanced margin requirements become applicable

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on affected securities with increased trading costs due to higher margin requirements. The measure aims to curb excessive speculation and maintain market stability. Exclusion of 4 securities from ASM provides relief to those stocks, potentially improving liquidity.
