title: Quality Control Orders for Refined Zinc and Nickel - BIS Certification Mandatory
---

## Summary

The Ministry of Mines has issued Quality Control Orders for Refined Zinc and Refined Nickel, making BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) certification mandatory for these products. The orders will come into effect six months from April 17, 2025 (notification date), making BIS Standard Mark compulsory for all refined zinc and nickel products sold in the domestic market.

## Key Points

- Two separate Quality Control Orders issued: Refined Zinc (Quality Control) Order, 2025 and Refined Nickel (Quality Control) Order, 2025
- Orders published on April 17, 2025, effective six months from publication date
- Mandatory BIS certification under Scheme-1 of Schedule-II of BIS (Conformity Assessment) Regulations, 2018
- Export goods are exempted from these requirements
- Bureau of Indian Standards will be both certifying and enforcing authority

## Regulatory Changes

- **Refined Zinc**: Must conform to IS 209:2024 (Refined Zinc - Specification) and bear Standard Mark
- **Refined Nickel**: Must conform to IS 2782:2023 (Refined Nickel - Specification) and bear Standard Mark
- Latest versions of Indian Standards will apply from the date of BIS notification
- Non-compliance will be subject to enforcement action by BIS

## Compliance Requirements

- Manufacturers must obtain BIS license for Standard Mark usage
- Products must undergo conformity assessment as per BIS regulations
- Goods must bear the Standard Mark before sale in domestic market
- Compliance with latest versions of respective Indian Standards mandatory
- Export goods exempt from certification requirements

## Important Dates

- **Notification Date**: April 17, 2025
- **Effective Date**: Six months from April 17, 2025 (approximately October 17, 2025)
- Standard compliance based on latest BIS notifications from time to time

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Metal Industry**: This regulation will significantly affect refined zinc and nickel manufacturers, importers, traders, and end-users. Companies will need to invest in BIS certification processes, potentially leading to increased compliance costs and time. The quality standardization may improve product reliability but could create supply chain disruptions during the transition period. Export-oriented businesses remain unaffected, but domestic market players must ensure full compliance before the effective date.
