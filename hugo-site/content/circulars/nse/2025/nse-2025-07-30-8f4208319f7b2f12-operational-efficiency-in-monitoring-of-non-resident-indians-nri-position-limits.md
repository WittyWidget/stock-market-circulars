title: Operational Efficiency in Monitoring of Non-Resident Indians (NRI) Position
  Limits in Exchange Traded Derivatives Contracts - Ease of Doing Investment
---

## Summary

SEBI has eliminated the mandatory requirement for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) to notify clearing member names and obtain Custodial Participant (CP) codes for trading in exchange-traded derivatives contracts. This operational change aims to enhance ease of investment and bring efficiency to NRI derivatives trading processes.

## Key Points

- Removes mandatory notification of clearing member names by NRIs to exchanges
- Eliminates requirement for exchanges to assign unique CP codes to NRIs
- NRI position limits will be monitored similar to regular client-level position limits
- Position limits for NRIs remain same as client-level limits specified by SEBI
- Existing NRI clients can opt out of CP code system within 90 days

## Regulatory Changes

- Discontinuation of Para II requirements from SEBI Circular SEBI/DNPD/Cir-17/2003/10/29 dated October 29, 2003
- New monitoring framework for NRI position limits aligned with regular client monitoring
- Operational flexibility for NRIs to exit or opt for CP code system based on preference

## Compliance Requirements

- Exchanges/Clearing Corporations must notify members and publish on websites
- Amend relevant bye-laws, rules, regulations, circulars, SOPs and FAQs
- Develop operational guidelines within 30 days from circular issuance
- Provide exit option to existing NRI clients with CP codes within 90 days
- Enable operational changes for NRIs to switch between CP code and non-CP code systems

## Important Dates

- **July 30, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **August 29, 2025**: Deadline for exchanges to issue operational guidelines (30 days)
- **October 28, 2025**: Deadline for existing NRI clients to exit CP code system (90 days)

## Impact Assessment

This change simplifies the derivatives trading process for NRIs by removing bureaucratic requirements while maintaining regulatory oversight through existing client-level monitoring systems. The impact is positive for NRI participation in Indian derivatives markets, potentially increasing accessibility and reducing operational complexity for brokers handling NRI accounts.
