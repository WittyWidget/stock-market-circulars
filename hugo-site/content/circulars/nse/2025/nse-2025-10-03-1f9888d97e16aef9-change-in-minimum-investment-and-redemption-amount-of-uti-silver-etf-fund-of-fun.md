---

## Summary

UTI Mutual Fund has revised the minimum investment and redemption amounts for its UTI Silver ETF Fund of Fund scheme on the NSE MF Invest Platform. The minimum initial investment amount has been reduced from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 100, and the minimum SIP amount has been reduced from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100 for daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies. These changes apply on a prospective basis.

## Key Points

- Minimum SIP amount reduced from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100 for daily, weekly, and monthly frequencies
- Subsequent minimum investment under a folio reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100
- Minimum redemption amount reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100 (and multiples of Re. 1 thereafter)
- Changes apply to UTI Silver ETF Fund of Fund scheme only
- All other terms and conditions of the scheme remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

Members of NSE MF Invest Platform should:
- Take note of the revised minimum investment and redemption amounts
- Update their systems and processes to reflect the new amounts for the UTI Silver ETF Fund of Fund scheme

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: October 3, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 3, 2025
- **Addendum Date**: September 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This change significantly lowers the barrier to entry for retail investors interested in the UTI Silver ETF Fund of Fund scheme. By reducing the minimum investment from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 100 and SIP amounts from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100, the scheme becomes more accessible to small investors. The impact is limited to this specific mutual fund scheme and does not affect broader market operations or trading activities. The change is investor-friendly and may increase participation in the scheme.
