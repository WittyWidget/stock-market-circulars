## Summary

NSE has announced the suspension of trading in Non-Convertible Debentures of two companies effective August 13, 2025. The suspensions are due to redemption of the debentures as per normal maturity process.

## Key Points

- Two NCDs will be suspended from trading on NSE
- Suspension effective from August 13, 2025
- Both suspensions are due to redemption of the debentures
- Action taken under Regulation 3.1.2 of NSE Debt Market Trading Regulations Part A

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is routine implementation of existing regulations governing debt market trading suspensions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must cease trading in the specified NCDs from the suspension date
- No additional compliance requirements beyond standard trading suspension protocols

## Important Dates

- **August 13, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date for both NCDs

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is a routine administrative action for maturing debt securities. The suspension affects only holders and traders of these specific NCDs. No broader market implications expected as this is part of normal debt instrument lifecycle management.
