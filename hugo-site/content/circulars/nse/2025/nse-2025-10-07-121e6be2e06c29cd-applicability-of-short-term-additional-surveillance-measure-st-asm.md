title: Applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective October 08, 2025. Seven securities have been added to ST-ASM Stage-I, while five securities are being excluded from the ASM framework entirely. One security (AAA Technologies Limited) has been moved from ST-ASM to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework. No securities are currently in ST-ASM Stage-II, and no securities are moving between stages.

## Key Points

- 7 securities added to Short-Term ASM Framework Stage-I: Anondita Medicare Limited, Banco Products (I) Limited, Orient Technologies Limited, Raj Oil Mills Limited, Take Solutions Limited, TechD Cybersecurity Limited, and V2 Retail Limited
- No securities added to or currently in Stage-II
- 5 securities excluded from ASM Framework: AAA Technologies Limited (moved to ESM), Affordable Robotic & Automation Limited, Kay Cee Energy & Infra Limited, OM INFRA LIMITED, and Spacenet Enterprises India Limited
- No inter-stage movements between Stage-I and Stage-II
- Consolidated ASM list contains 25 securities in Stage-I
- Changes effective from October 08, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework is a surveillance mechanism designed to alert investors about securities showing abnormal price movements or unusual trading patterns. Securities under ST-ASM are subject to additional trading restrictions including reduced price bands, 100% margin requirements, and trade-for-trade settlement to curb excessive speculation.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised surveillance classification for affected securities
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect ST-ASM Stage-I applicability for newly added securities
- Investors trading in these securities will face enhanced margin requirements and settlement obligations
- Securities excluded from ASM framework will return to normal trading conditions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 08, 2025 - ST-ASM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 7 securities to ST-ASM Stage-I will result in stricter trading conditions including higher margins and restricted price movements, potentially reducing liquidity and speculative activity in these stocks. The exclusion of 5 securities from ASM framework indicates improved price stability and trading patterns, allowing these stocks to return to normal trading conditions. The movement of AAA Technologies Limited to ESM framework suggests more serious concerns requiring enhanced oversight. Overall impact is moderate, affecting a small subset of listed securities with specific surveillance concerns.
