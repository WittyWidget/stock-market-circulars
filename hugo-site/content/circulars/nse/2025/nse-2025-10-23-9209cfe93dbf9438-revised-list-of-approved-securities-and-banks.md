title: Revised List of Approved Securities and Banks - Sovereign Gold Bonds Update
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a revised list of approved securities eligible as collateral for liquid assets, specifically covering Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs), Government Securities (G-Sec), and Treasury Bills (T-Bills). The circular confirms that all SGB/G-Sec/T-Bill instruments issued by RBI during the month shall be accepted from their date of issue. A total of 43 Sovereign Gold Bonds are listed with their ISIN codes, security descriptions, symbols, and applicable haircuts.

## Key Points

- All Sovereign Gold Bonds, G-Sec, and T-Bills issued by RBI are accepted as collateral from date of issue
- Uniform haircut of 10% (0.1) applies to all listed Sovereign Gold Bonds
- 43 different SGB series are approved, with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2032
- All SGBs carry a 2.50% coupon rate
- Securities are identified by ISIN codes and trading symbols for clear identification

## Regulatory Changes

This circular provides an updated reference list of approved collateral securities. The inclusion of SGBs from various series (2017-2023 issuances) ensures market participants have clarity on which specific instruments qualify as acceptable collateral for margin and liquid asset requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and clearing members must use only the securities listed in this circular as approved collateral
- Apply the specified 10% haircut when calculating collateral value for all Sovereign Gold Bonds
- Ensure proper identification of securities using the provided ISIN codes and symbols
- Accept newly issued SGB/G-Sec/T-Bills from RBI starting from their issue date

## Important Dates

- SGB maturity dates range from 2025 to 2032 across different series
- Earliest maturing SGBs: November-December 2025 series
- Latest maturing SGBs: February 2032 series
- New issuances by RBI to be accepted from date of issue

## Impact Assessment

This circular impacts brokers, trading members, and institutional participants who utilize government securities as collateral for trading activities. The standardized 10% haircut across all SGBs provides consistency in collateral valuation. Market participants can continue using the wide range of SGB series (spanning 7 years of issuances) as eligible collateral, maintaining flexibility in collateral management while ensuring adequate risk margins through the haircut mechanism.
