title: Discontinuation of SIPs with Instalment amount less than Rs.100 in Navi Mutual
  Fund Schemes on NSE MF Invest Platform
---

## Summary

NSE has notified that all Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) with instalment amounts less than Rs.100 in Navi Mutual Fund schemes will be automatically cancelled effective August 1, 2025. Investors have been given options to either increase their SIP amount or voluntarily cancel before the deadline.

## Key Points

- SIPs with instalment amount less than Rs.100 will be automatically cancelled from August 1, 2025
- Applies to all existing schemes of Navi Mutual Fund on NSE MF Invest Platform
- Investors can top up SIP amounts to Rs.100 or above until July 31, 2025
- Voluntary cancellation option available through existing SIP cancellation process
- No action by investor will result in automatic cancellation by RTA/AMC
- Top-up option applicable across all frequencies and plans except ELSS funds

## Regulatory Changes

Navi Mutual Fund has implemented a minimum SIP instalment requirement of Rs.100, discontinuing smaller amount SIPs to streamline operations and improve cost efficiency.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must inform affected investors about the policy change
- Investors with sub-Rs.100 SIPs must take action before July 31, 2025
- RTA/AMC will automatically cancel qualifying SIPs if no investor action is taken

## Important Dates

- **July 31, 2025**: Last date for investors to top up SIP amounts or voluntarily cancel
- **August 1, 2025**: Automatic cancellation of sub-Rs.100 SIPs takes effect

## Impact Assessment

This change will affect small retail investors who have been investing minimal amounts through SIPs. While it may consolidate smaller investments, it could also reduce accessibility for very small investors. The advance notice period provides adequate time for investors to adjust their investment strategy.
