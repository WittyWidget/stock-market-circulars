## Impact Assessment

The listing introduces a new agro-chemical company to NSE's Capital Market segment. With 64.28 million shares and an issue price of Rs. 100, the IPO represents a significant capital raising event. The staggered lock-in periods (extending to April 2027) indicate substantial promoter and early investor holdings that will gradually become tradable. Market participants should note the initial trading in BE series with subsequent migration to EQ series, which is standard for new IPO listings.
