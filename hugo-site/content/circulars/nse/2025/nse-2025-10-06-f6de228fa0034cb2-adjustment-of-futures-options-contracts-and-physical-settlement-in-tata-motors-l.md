- **October 14, 2025**: Final MTM settlement pay-in/pay-out (T+1); physical settlement in Capital Market segment under settlement number 2025195

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Forces early expiry of all TATAMOTORS derivative contracts regardless of original expiry dates, potentially disrupting hedging and trading strategies for market participants with open positions.

**Operational Impact**: High - Requires physical settlement of all F&O positions, creating delivery obligations that must be fulfilled with actual shares. Members need to arrange for securities/funds to meet obligations or face close-out of shortages.

**Trading Impact**: All existing positions in TATAMOTORS futures and options will cease to exist after Oct 13, 2025, requiring traders to either fulfill physical delivery obligations or exit positions before the expiry date. The netting mechanism with Capital Market obligations may result in net buy or sell obligations in the cash segment.
