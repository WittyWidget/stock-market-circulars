title: Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - September 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework affecting multiple securities. New securities will attract minimum 100% margin requirements and shift from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment. Some securities are moving between ESM stages with varying restrictions.

## Key Points

- New securities added to ESM Stage-I with 100% margin requirement
- Securities shifting from EQ/SM to BE/ST segment
- Stage-II securities under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Price bands will be reinstated when securities move out of framework

## Regulatory Changes

- Enhanced Surveillance Measure implementation with staged approach
- Minimum 100% margin on all open and new positions
- Segment shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade (BE/ST)
- Price band restrictions of 2% for Stage-II securities under Periodic Call Auction

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain 100% margin for affected securities
- Trading members must note segment changes for affected securities
- Compliance with all prevailing surveillance measures remains mandatory
- Securities under ESM subject to additional trading restrictions

## Important Dates

- **September 8, 2025**: Stage transitions effective, Stage-II securities under 2% price band
- **September 9, 2025**: 100% margin requirement effective, segment shifts from EQ/SM to BE/ST

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact**: The 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for trading these securities. The shift to Trade-for-Trade segment eliminates intraday trading opportunities and increases settlement obligations. Stage-II securities face additional price band restrictions limiting volatility. Market participants trading these securities will face increased costs and reduced liquidity.
