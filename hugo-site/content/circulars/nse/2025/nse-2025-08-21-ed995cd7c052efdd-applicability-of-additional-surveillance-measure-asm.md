title: Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - Securities Moved to Long Term Framework
---

## Summary

NSE has implemented Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) affecting Grand Continent Hotels Limited (GCHOTELS) and BGR Energy Systems Limited (BGRENERGY). The measure includes 100% margin requirements and segment shifts effective August 26, 2025.

## Key Points

- Grand Continent Hotels Limited added to Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- BGR Energy Systems Limited moved from Stage-I to Stage-IV under Long-Term ASM Framework
- 100% margin requirement applicable on all positions
- BGR Energy Systems to be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ) to Trade-for-Trade (BE) segment
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure criteria
- Margin requirements increased to 100% for affected securities
- Segment classification change for securities meeting Criteria VII (Stage IV)

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain 100% margin for affected securities
- All open positions as of August 25, 2025 subject to new margin requirements
- New positions from August 26, 2025 onwards subject to 100% margin
- BGR Energy Systems trading restricted to Trade-for-Trade segment

## Important Dates

- **August 26, 2025**: Effective date for 100% margin requirement
- **August 26, 2025**: BGR Energy Systems shifts to Trade-for-Trade segment (T+3 basis from circular date August 21, 2025)
- **August 25, 2025**: Cut-off date for existing positions subject to new margin requirements

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact**: The 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for trading these securities. BGR Energy Systems faces additional restriction with segment shift to Trade-for-Trade, limiting liquidity and trading flexibility. These measures are purely surveillance-based and not adverse actions against the companies, but will substantially impact trading activity and investor participation in these securities.
