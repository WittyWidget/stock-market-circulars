## Impact Assessment

**High Impact**: This is a critical system upgrade affecting all members trading in the Commodity Derivatives Segment. Failure to upgrade to NEAT 1.5.3 will result in inability to trade from October 27, 2025 onwards. The mandatory nature of this upgrade and complete discontinuation of previous versions requires immediate action from all trading members. Members must allocate technical resources to download, install, test the new version, and participate in the mock session to ensure smooth trading operations. The mock session provides the only opportunity to test the new system before live trading resumes on Monday, October 27, 2025.
