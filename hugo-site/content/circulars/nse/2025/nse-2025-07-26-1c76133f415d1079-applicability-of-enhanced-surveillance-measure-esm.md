title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Classification Changes
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework affecting multiple securities with stage transitions and new inclusions. Three securities are newly included in ESM Stage-I with 100% margin requirements, one security moves from Stage-I to Stage-II, and five securities are downgraded from Stage-II to Stage-I. The changes are effective July 28-29, 2025.

## Key Points

- Three new securities added to ESM Stage-I: Indo Borax & Chemicals, Tejas Cargo India, and Winny Immigration & Education Services
- VCL (Vaxtex Cotfab Limited) moves from Stage-I to Stage-II with stricter surveillance
- Five securities downgraded from Stage-II to Stage-I including ABS Marine Services, Agni Green Power, Everest Industries, Flexituff Ventures, and Ginni Filaments
- Securities in ESM attract minimum 100% margin on all positions
- ESM securities shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST)

## Regulatory Changes

- Enhanced Surveillance Measure classifications updated across multiple securities
- Stage-II securities operate under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Margin requirements of 100% minimum applied to ESM securities
- Trading segment changes from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade for affected securities

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure 100% margin compliance for ESM securities
- Trading restrictions apply through Trade-for-Trade mechanism
- Price band limitations of 2% for Stage-II securities under Periodic Call Auction
- Market participants must adapt to conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **July 28, 2025**: Stage transitions effective, Stage-II securities under Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band
- **July 29, 2025**: 100% margin requirement effective on all open positions and new positions, EQ/SM to BE/ST segment shift

## Impact Assessment

The circular affects trading flexibility and margin requirements for the specified securities. New ESM inclusions will face increased margin costs and reduced liquidity through Trade-for-Trade mechanisms. Securities moving to Stage-II face additional price band restrictions. The surveillance framework operates as a market monitoring tool rather than adverse action against companies, but impacts trading dynamics and investor accessibility for affected securities.
