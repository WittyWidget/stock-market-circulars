- **Stage I**: 100% margin rate and 5% price band

- **Stage IV**: Trade-for-trade with 5% price band, weekly trading, 100% ASD, and no upward price movement

DIGJAM LIMITED is now subject to Stage III restrictions, representing a significant escalation in surveillance measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must ensure trade-for-trade settlement for DIGJAM LIMITED with no netting off
- **Buyers**: Must deposit 100% ASD of trade value for all purchases
- **All Members**: Required to exercise adequate precautions when trading in this security
- **Settlement**: All trades must be settled on a delivery basis only
- **Trading Window**: Trades can only be executed on Mondays or the first trading day of each week

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 16, 2025 - Stage III GSM measures become applicable
- **Trading Days**: Every Monday or first trading day of the week only

## Impact Assessment

**Liquidity Impact**: Severe reduction in trading liquidity for DIGJAM LIMITED due to once-per-week trading restriction and 100% ASD requirement, which will likely deter speculative and short-term trading activity.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders face significant liquidity constraints and exit challenges. Buyers must arrange 100% upfront ASD in addition to regular margins, substantially increasing capital requirements.

**Price Discovery**: Limited to weekly trading sessions with 5% price band, potentially causing price volatility during the single weekly trading window.

**Market Signal**: Stage III GSM placement indicates serious concerns about the security's trading patterns, volatility, or compliance issues, serving as a strong cautionary signal to market participants.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must implement special handling procedures for this security, including weekly trading schedules and enhanced ASD collection mechanisms.
