title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Addition of 4 Securities to Stage I
---

## Summary

NSE has placed 4 securities under Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Stage I effective October 8, 2025. These securities will also be transferred from EQ/SM segment to BE/ST segment from October 9, 2025. No securities are being moved between stages or excluded from the ESM framework. The consolidated ESM list comprises 61 securities - 34 in Stage I and 27 in Stage II.

## Key Points

- 4 new securities added to ESM Stage I: AAA Technologies Limited, Arihant Academy Limited, Parin Enterprises Limited, and Sigma Solve Limited
- Segment change from EQ/SM to BE/ST effective October 9, 2025 for all 4 securities
- No securities moving from Stage I to Stage II or vice versa
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- Total 61 securities under ESM surveillance (27 in Stage II, 34 in Stage I)

## Regulatory Changes

Enhanced Surveillance Measure imposes additional restrictions on identified securities including:
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday squaring off)
- Physical delivery obligations
- Segment transfer to BE/ST series for Stage I securities

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must collect 100% upfront margins from clients for ESM securities
- All trades in ESM securities subject to compulsory delivery
- Investors must settle trades through physical delivery of shares
- No margin trading facility or derivatives available for ESM securities

## Important Dates

- **October 8, 2025**: ESM Stage I applicability effective for 4 new securities
- **October 9, 2025**: Segment change from EQ/SM to BE/ST effective

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The transfer to BE/ST segment significantly restricts liquidity and trading activity. Investors holding these securities face mandatory delivery obligations and cannot engage in intraday trading.

**Investor Impact**: High - Existing shareholders may face difficulty in exiting positions due to reduced liquidity. New investors require full upfront payment with no leverage options.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members must update systems to enforce 100% margin collection and ensure trade-for-trade settlement for these securities.
