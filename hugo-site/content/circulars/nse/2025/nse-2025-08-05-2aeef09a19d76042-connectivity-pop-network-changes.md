title: NSE POP Network Changes - Migration of STT Kolkatta, Jeevan Vihar Delhi & Kohinoor
  Mumbai Facilities
---

## Summary

NSE announces the discontinuation and migration of existing POP (Point of Presence) facilities at three locations - STT Ultadanga Kolkata, Jivan Vihar Delhi, and Kohinoor Mumbai - to new Sify facilities. This is a partial modification to earlier circular NSE/MSD/67754 dated April 29, 2025, with specific migration timelines ranging from 120 to 180 days.

## Key Points

- Three existing POP facilities will be discontinued and migrated to new Sify locations
- STT Kolkata migrating to SIFY KOL at DLF IT Park, New Town
- Jeevan Vihar Delhi migrating to SIFY OKHLA at Okhla Industrial Area Phase-3
- Kohinoor Mumbai migrating to SIFY PARLE at Vile Parle East near airport
- Comprehensive escalation matrix provided for Sify support services
- Different timelines for each location migration

## Regulatory Changes

Partial modification to section I B. of Exchange circular NSE/MSD/67754 dated April 29, 2025, regarding POP facility locations and migration schedules.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must prepare for migration from existing POP facilities to new Sify locations
- Follow provided escalation matrix for connectivity issues during transition
- Coordinate with Sify for new line configuration and link health at POP level
- Use Aakash Portal for additional information and updates

## Important Dates

- **STT Kolkata to SIFY KOL**: 120 days from August 5, 2025 (by December 3, 2025)
- **Jeevan Vihar Delhi to SIFY OKHLA**: 120 days from August 5, 2025 (by December 3, 2025)
- **Kohinoor Mumbai to SIFY PARLE**: 180 days from August 5, 2025 (by February 1, 2026)

## Impact Assessment

High operational impact as this affects critical trading connectivity infrastructure for members at three major locations. Members will need to coordinate migration activities, potentially update their connectivity configurations, and ensure business continuity during the transition period. The staggered timeline provides some flexibility but requires careful planning, especially for Mumbai members who have a longer migration window.
