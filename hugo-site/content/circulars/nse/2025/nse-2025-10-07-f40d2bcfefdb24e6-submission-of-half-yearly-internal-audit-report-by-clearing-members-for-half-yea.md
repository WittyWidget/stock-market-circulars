## Summary

NSE has issued operational guidelines for clearing members and Professional Clearing Members (PCM) to submit their half-yearly internal audit reports for the period ending September 30, 2025. The circular provides detailed instructions for creating sub-users, registering internal auditors, and submitting reports through the NCL Member Portal at https://ims.connect2nsccl.com/NCLMemberPortal/. Members must register their internal auditors for each audit cycle, irrespective of whether the auditor was previously registered.

- Upon registration, auditors receive login credentials via email
- Members must create auditor sub-users with NCL_INSPECTION-INTERNAL AUDIT role
- All fields in auditor registration are mandatory except 'Expiry Date of COP'
- Edit facility available only if report not yet submitted by auditor
- Members must obtain 'Conflict of Interest' declaration from auditors
- Reports cover CM, FO, CD, and COM segments as applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**
Clearing members must allocate resources for the audit process and ensure timely completion of auditor registration and report submission. The requirement for fresh auditor registration each cycle adds administrative steps.

**Compliance Impact:**
High - This is a mandatory regulatory requirement for all clearing members. Non-compliance could result in regulatory action. The detailed procedural requirements necessitate careful attention to portal navigation and documentation submission.

**Market Impact:**
Indirect - While this is primarily a compliance requirement, proper internal audits enhance the overall integrity and risk management framework of the clearing ecosystem, contributing to market stability and investor protection.
