- SEBI has advised the exchange to make this move
- Continuation of previous circular NSE/CML/69465 dated August 04, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. Implementation of existing SEBI delisting regulations that allow compulsory delisted securities to trade on dissemination boards.
