  Platform
---

## Summary

NSE has notified members about changes in maximum application amounts for Edelweiss Greater China Equity Off-shore Fund on the NSE MF Invest Platform. The maximum application amount has been increased from INR 10 lakh to INR 25 lakh per PAN per day for all subscription types including Lumpsum, Switch-in, SIP, and STP transactions.

## Key Points

- Maximum application amount increased to INR 25,00,000 per PAN per day (from INR 10 lakh)
- Applicable for Lumpsum, Switch-in, SIP, and STP transactions
- Change specific to Edelweiss Greater China Equity Off-shore Fund only
- Based on available headroom for overseas investment limits
- Existing systematic transactions (SIPs/STPs) remain unaffected
- All other offshore funds maintain INR 10 lakh per PAN per day limit

## Regulatory Changes

The change is pursuant to SEBI letter dated June 17, 2022 (SEBI/HO/OW/IMD-II/DOF3/25095/2022) which allowed mutual funds to resume subscriptions and investments in overseas securities up to available headroom without breaching overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022.

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must implement the revised maximum application amount limits
- Transaction reporting date will be used for applying the revised limits
- Transactions reported till July 30, 2025 before cut-off time will not be subject to new limit restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 31, 2025
- **Cut-off for old limits**: July 30, 2025 (before cut-off time)
- **Transaction basis**: Based on transaction reporting date

## Impact Assessment

Positive impact for investors seeking higher exposure to Greater China equity markets through this offshore fund. The 150% increase in daily subscription limit (from INR 10 lakh to INR 25 lakh) provides greater flexibility for large investors while maintaining regulatory compliance with overseas investment limits. Impact is limited to this specific scheme and does not affect other offshore funds.
