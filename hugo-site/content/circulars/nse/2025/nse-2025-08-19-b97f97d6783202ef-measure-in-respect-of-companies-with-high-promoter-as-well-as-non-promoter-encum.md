title: Surveillance Measure for Companies with High Promoter and Non-Promoter Encumbrance
  - August 2025 Update
---

## Summary

NSE has updated its surveillance measure for companies with high promoter and non-promoter encumbrance under SEBI (SAST) Regulation 28(3). One new security (Hindusthan National Glass & Industries Limited) has been added to the framework, while no securities have been excluded. The measure requires minimum 75% margin in equity and equity derivatives segments.

## Key Points

- One security added to surveillance framework: HINDNATGLS (Hindusthan National Glass & Industries Limited)
- No securities excluded from the framework in this update
- Consolidated list now contains 5 securities under the encumbrance measure
- Minimum 75% margin requirement applies to both equity and equity derivatives segments
- Measure applies to all open positions and new positions created

## Regulatory Changes

The surveillance measure is implemented under SEBI (SAST) Regulation 2011, specifically Regulation 28(3) dealing with high promoter and non-promoter encumbrance. This is a continuation of the framework established in January 2022.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 75% minimum margin for affected securities
- Margin requirements apply to all open positions as of August 21, 2025
- New positions created from August 22, 2025 onwards must comply with margin requirements
- Measure works in conjunction with other prevailing exchange measures

## Important Dates

- **August 20, 2025**: Effective date for exclusions (none in this update)
- **August 21, 2025**: Cut-off date for existing open positions
- **August 22, 2025**: 75% margin requirement becomes effective for HINDNATGLS

## Impact Assessment

The addition of one security to the surveillance framework has limited market impact. The 75% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for trading in affected securities, potentially reducing speculative activity. The consolidated list of 5 securities (FMNL, HINDNATGLS, INDOTECH, STEELXIND, THYROCARE) remains subject to periodic review. The exchange clarifies that inclusion should not be construed as adverse action against the companies.
