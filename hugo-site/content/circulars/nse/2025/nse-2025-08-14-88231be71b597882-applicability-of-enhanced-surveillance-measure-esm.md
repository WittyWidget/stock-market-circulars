title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Movement and New Inclusions
---

## Summary

NSE has announced changes to Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework affecting multiple securities. New securities will be included in ESM Stage-I with 100% margin requirements, while existing securities will move between stages. All affected securities will be shifted from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment effective August 19, 2025.

## Key Points

- NDL Ventures Limited added to ESM Stage-I with 100% margin requirement
- R.S. Software moving from ESM Stage-I to Stage-II under Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band
- Seven securities moving from ESM Stage-II back to Stage-I
- All ESM securities shifted from EQ/SM series to BE/ST series (Trade-for-Trade)
- 100% margin applies to all open positions as of August 18, 2025 and new positions from August 19, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

- Securities under ESM Stage-II will trade under Periodic Call Auction mechanism with 2% price band
- Trade-for-Trade segment implementation for all ESM securities
- Enhanced margin requirements of minimum 100% for ESM Stage-I securities
- Price band restoration for securities exiting the framework

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure adequate margins for ESM securities
- Compliance with Trade-for-Trade settlement requirements
- Adherence to price band restrictions for Stage-II securities
- Monitor consolidated list of securities under ESM framework

## Important Dates

- **August 18, 2025**: ESM Stage movements effective, Stage-II securities under Periodic Call Auction
- **August 19, 2025**: 100% margin requirement effective, Trade-for-Trade segment shift effective

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact**: The implementation of 100% margin requirements and Trade-for-Trade restrictions significantly limits liquidity and increases trading costs for affected securities. The shift to Periodic Call Auction for Stage-II securities further restricts trading frequency. Market participants holding positions in these securities face increased capital requirements and reduced trading flexibility.
