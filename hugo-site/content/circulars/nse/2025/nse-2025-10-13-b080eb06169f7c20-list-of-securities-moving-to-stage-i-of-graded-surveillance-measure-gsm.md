- **Effective Date:** October 14, 2025 - DIGJAMLMTD moves to Stage I of GSM

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** The placement of DIGJAM LIMITED under Stage I GSM will significantly impact trading by requiring 100% upfront margin, which may reduce trading volumes and liquidity in the security. The 5% price band restriction will limit daily price volatility.

**Market Participants:** Traders and investors in DIGJAMLMTD will need to arrange for full margin requirements, making leveraged positions impossible. This is designed to curb excessive speculation and volatility.

**Risk Signal:** Placement under GSM Stage I serves as a cautionary signal to market participants about potential concerns regarding the security's trading pattern or other surveillance parameters. Members are explicitly advised to take adequate precautions.

**Progressive Framework:** The GSM framework allows for escalation to more stringent stages (II, III, IV) if concerns persist, potentially leading to trade-for-trade settlement, weekly trading restrictions, and additional surveillance deposits.
