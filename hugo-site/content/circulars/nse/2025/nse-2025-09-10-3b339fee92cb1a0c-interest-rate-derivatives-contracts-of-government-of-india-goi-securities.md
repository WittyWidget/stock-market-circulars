title: Introduction of Interest Rate Derivatives Contracts for GOI Securities
---

## Summary

NSE will introduce Interest Rate Futures and Options contracts for two Government of India (GOI) securities starting September 12, 2025. The contracts will be available for 601GS2030 (6.01% coupon, July 21, 2030 maturity) and 668GS2040 (6.68% coupon, July 7, 2040 maturity) securities.

## Key Points

- Two new GOI securities added for Interest Rate Derivatives trading
- Contracts include both Futures (FUTIRC) and Options (OPTIRC)
- Lot size: Rs 2 lakhs face value equivalent to 2000 units
- Quantity freeze at 1251 lots or greater
- Monthly and quarterly expiry options available
- Spread contracts with dual leg structure

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation follows SEBI master circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD2/PoD-2/CIR/P/2024/181 dated December 30, 2024, regarding guidelines for underlying selection in Cash Settled Interest Rate Futures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must download cd_contract.gz, cd_spd_contract.gz, and MII Contract & Spd files from Extranet paths /cdsftp/cdscommon
- Local database must be updated before trading on go-live date
- Orders must be placed in terms of number of lots

## Important Dates

- **Go-live Date**: September 12, 2025
- **Monthly Expiries**: September 25, October 30, November 27, December 24, 2025
- **Quarterly Expiries**: March 26, June 25, 2026
- **Exclusion Dates**: June 2026 expiry for 601GS2030, June 2029 expiry for 668GS2040

## Impact Assessment

This expansion of Interest Rate Derivatives will provide additional hedging and trading opportunities for market participants dealing with government securities. The introduction of longer-duration contracts (up to 2040 maturity) allows for better duration risk management across the yield curve.
