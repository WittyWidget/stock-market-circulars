## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has announced the suspension of trading in one Non-Convertible Debenture (Privately Placed) issued by State Bank of India. The suspension is effective from October 09, 2025, and is being implemented due to the redemption of the instrument following the exercise of a call option. This action is taken in accordance with Regulation 3.1.2 of the NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A.

## Key Points

- Reason: Redemption for exercising call option
- Action taken under NSE Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A, Regulation 3.1.2
- Circular issued by NSE Listing Department
- Circular reference number: 1947/2025

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must note the suspension of trading in the specified NCD effective from the suspension date
- No trading shall be permitted in ISIN INE062A08264 from October 09, 2025
- Members must update their systems to reflect the suspension status

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 08, 2025
- **Suspension Effective Date**: October 09, 2025
- **Redemption Event**: Call option exercise triggering redemption

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is minimal and limited to holders of this specific State Bank of India NCD. The suspension is a routine administrative action resulting from the issuer exercising its call option to redeem the debt instrument. Trading members holding positions in this ISIN should be aware that no further trading will be possible after the suspension date. The redemption process will follow standard settlement procedures. This does not affect other debt instruments issued by State Bank of India or the bank's equity shares. Market-wide impact is negligible as this pertains to a single privately placed debt security.
