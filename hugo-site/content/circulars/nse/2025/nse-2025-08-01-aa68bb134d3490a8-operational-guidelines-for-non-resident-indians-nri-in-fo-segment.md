## Summary

NSE has discontinued the mandatory requirement for Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) to obtain Custodian Participant (CP) codes for trading in the Futures & Options segment. Existing NRI clients with CP codes can choose to exit this mechanism by October 27, 2025, while new NRI clients can directly trade without CP codes.

## Key Points

- 90-day window provided for existing clients to request exit (until October 27, 2025)
- Clearing members must facilitate exit requests through email communication
- CP codes with open positions can only be deactivated after positions are closed

## Regulatory Changes

- Simplified operational framework for NRI participation in derivatives trading
- Retained flexibility for NRIs who wish to continue with CP code mechanism

## Compliance Requirements

- Exit requests to be processed through email communication within 90 days
- Deactivation requests for CP codes with no open positions to be submitted to Clearing Corporation
- Members must implement operational changes to accommodate future exit requests from NRI clients

## Important Dates

- **Immediate Effect**: CP code requirement discontinued for new NRI clients
- **October 27, 2025**: Deadline for existing NRI clients to request exit from CP mechanism (90 days from SEBI circular dated July 29, 2025)
