## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has issued instructions regarding early pay-in of securities for Gokul Agro Resources Limited (GOKULAGRO) in connection with a face value split from Rs 2/- per share to Re 1/- per share. The circular provides specific guidance on using old and new ISINs for early pay-in during the transition period around the record date of October 14, 2025.

## Key Points

- Face value split (sub-division) from Rs 2/- per share to Re 1/- per share
- Existing/Old ISIN: INE314T01025
- Record Date and Ex Date: October 14, 2025
- Members must use old ISIN for early pay-in on October 14-15, 2025 without adjusting for conversion
- After record date, new ISIN must be used for pay-in/early pay-in instructions
- Example: For sale of 2 shares, early pay-in should be 1 share in old ISIN on ex-date
- Client-wise allocation file should not be uploaded when using block mechanism
- Custodians using pool accounts must upload allocation details based on actual traded quantity

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements procedures under Item 10.18 'Early Pay-in of Securities for Margin Exemption' from the consolidated circular (NCL/CMPT/67751) dated April 29, 2025. Members must adhere to SEBI circular on Block Mechanism in demat accounts as per NCL circular NCL/CMPT/53386 dated August 22, 2022.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Market Participants/Members:**
- Execute early pay-in instructions in old ISIN (INE314T01025) for settlement numbers 2025196 (October 14) and 2025196 & 2025197 (October 15)
- Do not adjust for conversion ratio when using old ISIN
- Switch to new ISIN after record date for all subsequent pay-in instructions
- Follow block mechanism procedures without uploading client-wise allocation file for early pay-in

**For Custodians:**
- If providing early pay-in through pool account, upload client-wise allocation details based on actual traded quantity (post-split quantity)
- Execute early pay-in in old ISIN on ex-date/record date
- Transition to new ISIN after record date

## Important Dates

- **October 13, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **October 14, 2025**: Record Date and Ex Date
- **October 14, 2025**: Settlement 2025196 - Use old ISIN for early pay-in
- **October 15, 2025**: Settlements 2025196 & 2025197 - Use old ISIN for early pay-in on 14th, new ISIN thereafter
- **After October 14, 2025**: Use new ISIN for all pay-in/early pay-in instructions

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Members and custodians must implement dual-ISIN handling procedures during the transition period. Failure to use correct ISIN could result in settlement failures and margin implications.

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects all trading participants holding or trading GOKULAGRO securities. The face value split doubles the number of shares while halving the face value, requiring careful attention to quantity adjustments.

**System Impact:** Members' systems must handle the ISIN transition correctly, with old ISIN used for specific settlement dates and new ISIN used thereafter. Early pay-in margin exemption benefits can only be obtained by following correct procedures.
