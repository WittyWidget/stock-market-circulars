## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Special trading session for major stock Tata Motors will affect all market participants. Price discovery mechanism during SPOS will determine opening price and subsequent trading. Failure to discover equilibrium price will result in continued call auction, potentially delaying normal trading.

**Trading Impact**: Members must prepare systems with updated security files. Special order handling rules apply during SPOS with specific risk management parameters. Block deal traders can only participate in second session contingent on successful price discovery.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their trading applications with latest security files and ensure traders understand SPOS mechanics, including call auction rules, dynamic price bands, and order migration to normal session.
