title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure under IBC
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a circular regarding the applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Ten securities are moving to "Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company" category, indicating reduced surveillance requirements. No new securities are being added to ASM-IBC categories.

## Key Points

- No securities are being newly shortlisted under ASM-IBC Stage I or Stage II
- Ten companies are moving out of stricter ASM-IBC surveillance to disclosure-based monitoring
- ASM-IBC framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting under ASM-IBC is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

Effective August 1, 2025, ten securities will move from ASM-IBC surveillance to "Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company" category, representing a relaxation of surveillance measures for these entities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the changed surveillance status of the ten listed securities
- Companies moving to disclosure category must continue providing corporate announcements and disclosures as required
- Members should monitor these securities under the revised surveillance framework

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 1, 2025 - New ASM-IBC categorization takes effect
- **Circular Date**: July 31, 2025 - Official notification date

## Impact Assessment

Positive development for the ten affected companies as they move to less restrictive surveillance measures. This suggests improved compliance or resolution of issues that initially triggered ASM-IBC classification. Limited broader market impact as this affects specific companies rather than market-wide changes. The absence of new additions to ASM-IBC categories indicates stable conditions for companies under IBC proceedings.
