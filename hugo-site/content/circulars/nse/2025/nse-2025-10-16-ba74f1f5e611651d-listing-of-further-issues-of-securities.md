## Summary

NSE has approved the listing of further issues of equity shares for 10 companies on the Capital Market segment effective October 17, 2025. The shares were issued primarily under Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and one preferential allotment. Companies include Aavas Financiers Limited, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Limited, NIIT Learning Systems Limited, Poonawalla Fincorp Limited, Suprajit Engineering Limited, Suzlon Energy Limited, Tejas Networks Limited, Veranda Learning Solutions Limited, Adani Green Energy Limited, and Himadri Speciality Chemical Limited.

## Key Points

- 10 companies have received approval for listing additional equity shares
- Most shares issued under ESOP schemes with small quantities (4,400 to 25,000 shares)
- Poonawalla Fincorp has the largest issuance: 33,148,102 shares under preferential allotment at Rs. 452.51 per share
- All securities will be pari passu (equal ranking) with existing shares
- Market lot size is 1 for all securities
- Trading will commence on October 17, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification under Regulation 3.1.1 and 2.5.5 of NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must note the new ISIN codes and distinctive number ranges for trading purposes
- Securities will be identified by designated codes on the trading system
- Trading must be conducted in specified lot sizes (market lot of 1)

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 16, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 17, 2025
- **Allotment Dates**: 
  - Aavas Financiers: October 6, 2025
  - NIIT Learning Systems: October 8, 2025
  - Suprajit Engineering: October 9, 2025
  - ICICI Lombard: October 13, 2025
  - Poonawalla Fincorp: September 17, 2025
- **Lock-in Period**: Poonawalla Fincorp preferential shares locked until April 20, 2027; others not applicable

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. Most issuances are small ESOP allotments representing negligible dilution. The Poonawalla Fincorp preferential allotment of 33.15 million shares is material but was allotted on September 17, 2025, and is subject to lock-in until April 2027, limiting immediate trading impact. This is a routine administrative listing process with no effect on trading rules or market operations.
