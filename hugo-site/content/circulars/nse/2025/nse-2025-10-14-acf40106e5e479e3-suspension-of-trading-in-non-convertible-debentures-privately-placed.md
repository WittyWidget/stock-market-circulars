## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: October 14, 2025
- **Suspension Effective Date**: October 15, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited and routine. This is a standard operational suspension due to the scheduled redemption of debt securities. Holders of these NCDs will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of the instruments.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these specific ISINs will not be able to trade them on NSE after the suspension date. However, this is expected as the securities are being redeemed.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine corporate action that regularly occurs in the debt market when securities reach maturity or are called for redemption by the issuer.
