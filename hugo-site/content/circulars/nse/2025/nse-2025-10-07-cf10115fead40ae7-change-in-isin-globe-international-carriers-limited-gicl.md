## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The ISIN change is a routine corporate action resulting from share sub-division. While it requires system updates by all market participants, it does not affect the underlying value of holdings.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members, clearing corporations, depositories, and custodians must update their systems before the ex-date to ensure seamless processing of trades and corporate actions.

**Investor Impact**: Low to Medium - Existing shareholders will see their holding quantity doubled (due to 1:2 sub-division from Rs. 10 to Rs. 5 face value) with proportionate reduction in price per share. The overall investment value remains unchanged. Investors should verify the ISIN update in their demat accounts post-implementation.
