## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The further issues represent small percentages of existing share capital for these companies. For example, ITC's 707,230 shares is negligible compared to its total outstanding shares.

**Trading Impact**: Routine addition to tradable securities. No change to market lot sizes or trading mechanisms.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in floating stock for these companies. The ESOP shares will enhance liquidity slightly but are not expected to materially affect trading volumes or price discovery.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders face minimal dilution. Shares are pari passu with existing equity, ensuring equal rights for all shareholders.
