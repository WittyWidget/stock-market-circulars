## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. These are routine further issue listings primarily from ESOP exercises, representing small percentages of total outstanding shares. The preferential issue for BIL is locked-in until 2027.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Trading members need to be aware of the new securities available for trading from October 06, 2025, but no system changes or operational adjustments are required beyond normal listing processes.

**Investor Impact**: Negligible dilution effect given the relatively small number of shares being listed compared to existing equity base of these large-cap and mid-cap companies.
