## Important Dates

- **June 24, 2025**: ICICI Prudential Trust Limited Board approval
- **June 26, 2025**: ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company Limited Board approval
- **September 26, 2025**: SEBI no-objection communication received; notice published on AMC website
- **October 8, 2025**: Record date for merger
- **November 14, 2025**: Merger effective date (end of business hours)

## Impact Assessment

**Rationale for Merger:**

The merger is driven by changing market dynamics and operational challenges:

1. **Interest Rate Environment**: RBI executed substantial liquidity injections and enhanced bond purchases in February 2025 to address interbank cash shortages. Subsequently, RBI reduced interest rates by cumulative 100 basis points (25 bps in February, 25 bps in April, and 50 bps in June 2025).

2. **Market Dynamics**: Interest rate cuts and liquidity injections pushed bond yields lower, leading to limited investor interest in Debt Index Funds.

3. **AUM Challenges**: The Merging Scheme experienced sustained redemptions and continuous outflows, resulting in decreased Assets Under Management (AUM). Lower AUM makes it challenging to replicate the underlying index in accordance with regulatory guidelines and tracking difference requirements.

4. **Investment Mandates**: The Merging Scheme invests more than 95% in AAA-rated bonds of Financial Services Companies with securities maturing on or before December 2026 as part of the index.

**Impact on Unitholders:**

- Unitholders of the Merging Scheme will automatically become unitholders of the Surviving Scheme (ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond Fund)
- The merger is undertaken in the interest of unitholders given operational challenges
- No change in fundamental attributes of the Surviving Scheme
- Unitholders should review the comparative attributes of both schemes in the notice dated September 26, 2025
