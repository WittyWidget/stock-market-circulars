  8, 2025 for Mumbai Suburban District

## Summary

The Maharashtra Government has issued a notification under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 changing the Eid-e-Milad public holiday from Friday, September 5, 2025 to Monday, September 8, 2025, but only for Mumbai Suburban District. This change was made to maintain communal harmony as Anant Chaturdashi (Hindu festival) falls on Saturday, September 6, 2025. For all other districts in Maharashtra, Friday, September 5, 2025 remains the public holiday for Eid-e-Milad.

## Key Points

- Holiday change applies only to Mumbai City and Mumbai Suburban District
- Original date: Friday, September 5, 2025
- New date for Mumbai Suburban: Monday, September 8, 2025
- Rest of Maharashtra retains Friday, September 5, 2025 as the holiday
- Decision made after consultation with various Muslim organizations on August 21, 2025
- Muslim community agreed to celebrate on Monday to avoid conflict with Anant Chaturdashi

## Regulatory Changes

The notification is issued under Section 25 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, exercising powers delegated by the Central Government through notification dated May 8, 1968. This affects the previously notified 24 public holidays for Maharashtra state for 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Banking and financial institutions in Mumbai Suburban District must observe Monday, September 8, 2025 as holiday instead of Friday, September 5, 2025
- Trading operations and settlement schedules need adjustment for Mumbai Suburban District
- All other districts in Maharashtra continue with original Friday holiday

## Important Dates

- **Original Eid-e-Milad Date**: Friday, September 5, 2025 (retained for all districts except Mumbai Suburban)
- **New Eid-e-Milad Date for Mumbai Suburban**: Monday, September 8, 2025
- **Anant Chaturdashi**: Saturday, September 6, 2025
- **Notification Date**: September 3, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This change creates a bifurcated holiday schedule within Maharashtra state, potentially affecting:
- Inter-district financial transactions and settlements
- Trading operations that span multiple districts
- Coordination between Mumbai city and suburban operations
- Banking and financial services delivery across the state

The selective application to only Mumbai Suburban District while keeping the original date for other areas may require careful operational planning for financial institutions with pan-Maharashtra presence.
