title: Applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a circular regarding the applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective October 13, 2025. Seven securities are being placed under ST-ASM Stage I, while three securities are being excluded from the ASM framework. No securities are moving between stages or entering Stage II. The consolidated ASM list now contains at least 25 securities under Stage I.

## Key Points

- 7 securities shortlisted for ST-ASM Framework Stage I effective October 13, 2025
- No securities placed under ST-ASM Framework Stage II
- No securities moving between Stage I and Stage II
- 3 securities excluded from ASM framework (Palred Technologies moved to LT-ASM)
- Consolidated ASM framework list updated with current securities under surveillance

## Securities Entering ST-ASM Stage I

1. **BLUESTONE** - BlueStone Jewellery and Lifestyle Limited (INE304W01038)
2. **HYBRIDFIN** - Hybrid Financial Services Limited (INE965B01022)
3. **KEYFINSERV** - Keynote Financial Services Limited (INE681C01015)
4. **NAGREEKCAP** - Nagreeka Capital & Infrastructure Limited (INE245I01016)
5. **SHANKARA** - Shankara Building Products Limited (INE274V01019)
6. **WEWIN** - WE WIN LIMITED (INE082W01014)
7. **ZENITHSTL** - Zenith Steel Pipes & Industries Limited (INE318D01020)

## Securities Excluded from ASM Framework

1. **PALREDTEC** - Palred Technologies Limited (INE218G01033) - Moved from ST-ASM to LT-ASM framework
2. **RUSHIL** - Rushil Decor Limited (INE573K01025)
3. **UMIYA-MRO** - UMIYA BUILDCON LIMITED (INE398B01018)

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to operate with two stages (Stage I and Stage II) to monitor securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or other unusual trading patterns. Securities under this framework are subject to enhanced surveillance and may face trading restrictions to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with surveillance measures for listed securities
- Investors should be aware of securities under ST-ASM framework before trading
- Market participants must adhere to any additional margin requirements or trading restrictions applicable to ST-ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 13, 2025 - ST-ASM applicability and exclusions take effect

## Impact Assessment

The placement of seven securities under ST-ASM Stage I indicates heightened surveillance by NSE due to price volatility or unusual trading activity. This may result in:

- Increased margin requirements for these securities
- Potential impact on liquidity and trading volumes
- Enhanced monitoring of trading activities
- Investor caution in trading these securities

The exclusion of three securities from ASM framework (with one moving to LT-ASM) suggests improved trading patterns for two securities while Palred Technologies continues under long-term surveillance. Market participants should monitor these securities closely and consider the surveillance measures when making investment decisions.
