## Summary

NSE has issued updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework. Five securities are being included in ESM Stage-I, one security is moving from Stage-I to Stage-II, and no securities are being excluded. Securities under ESM Stage-I will shift from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade segment and attract 100% margin. Securities moving to Stage-II will be under trade-for-trade with 2% price band under periodic call auction.

## Key Points

- Five securities added to ESM Stage-I: Century Extrusions Limited, Nagreeka Capital & Infrastructure Limited, Nikita Papers Limited, Spacenet Enterprises India Limited, and Take Solutions Limited
- Divine Power Energy Limited (DPEL) moving from ESM Stage-I to Stage-II
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- Securities in Stage-I will shift from EQ/SM series to BE/ST series (trade-for-trade)
- 100% minimum margin applicable on all open and new positions for Stage-I securities
- ESM is a surveillance measure and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

Securities qualifying under ESM will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST). Securities moving to Stage-II will operate under trade-for-trade with a 2% price band under periodic call auction mechanism.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure 100% margin on all open positions as of October 14, 2025, and new positions created from October 15, 2025, for Stage-I securities
- Trading members must adjust to trade-for-trade settlement mechanism for affected securities
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **October 13, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 14, 2025**: Securities moving to Stage-II come under trade-for-trade with 2% price band under periodic call auction
- **October 15, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes effective for Stage-I securities; shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST series effective

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - The shift to trade-for-trade segment significantly impacts liquidity for affected securities as intraday trading is not permitted. The 100% margin requirement substantially increases capital requirements for traders.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to adjust their systems and inform clients about the change in trading mechanism. Existing positions will face increased margin requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities will face reduced liquidity and higher margin costs. The 2% price band for Stage-II securities limits price volatility but also restricts trading flexibility.
