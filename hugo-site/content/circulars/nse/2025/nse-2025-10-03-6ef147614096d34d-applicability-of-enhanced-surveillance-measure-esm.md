title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Stage Changes for Multiple Securities
---

## Summary

NSE has announced changes to Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) classifications effective October 6-7, 2025. Three securities (DIVINEHIRA, PROZONER, PSRAJ) are being newly included in ESM Stage-I with 100% margin requirements. One security (VIJIFIN) is being moved from Stage-I to Stage-II, while four securities (AGSTRA, KRISHIVAL, ORTINGLOBE, OSELDEVICE) are being moved from Stage-II back to Stage-I. Securities in ESM will be shifted from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment, with Stage-II securities under Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band.

## Key Points

- New inclusions in ESM Stage-I: Divine Hira Jewellers Limited, Prozone Realty Limited, and P S Raj Steels Limited
- Minimum 100% margin required on all open positions as on October 6, 2025 and new positions from October 7, 2025
- Securities qualifying under ESM shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST)
- Stage-II securities subject to Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- ESM framework applies in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting under ESM is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

- Divine Hira Jewellers Limited (DIVINEHIRA, ISIN: INE0NA501011)

## Important Dates

- **October 3, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 6, 2025**: 
  - 100% margin applicable on all open positions in newly included securities
  - Stage-II securities move to Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
  - Stage movement between Stage-I and Stage-II becomes effective
- **October 7, 2025**: 
  - Securities shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade (BE/ST)
  - 100% margin applicable on all new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:**
- Three securities moving to Trade-for-Trade segment will experience reduced liquidity as intraday trading will not be possible
- 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for traders holding positions in affected securities
- Stage-II securities face additional restriction of 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction, limiting price discovery

**Market Participants:**
- Traders with existing positions in DIVINEHIRA, PROZONER, and PSRAJ must arrange for 100% margin by October 6, 2025
- Reduced trading flexibility for all ESM securities due to Trade-for-Trade mechanism
- Four securities (AGSTRA, KRISHIVAL, ORTINGLOBE, OSELDEVICE) will see relaxation from Stage-II to Stage-I restrictions

**Investor Sentiment:**
- ESM inclusion typically signals heightened regulatory scrutiny and potential price volatility concerns
- While not an adverse action against companies, market perception may be negative
- Enhanced margins may deter speculative activity and improve price stability
