title: Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Implementation
---

## Summary

NSE has implemented Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I for Sarda Energy & Minerals Limited (SARDAEN) effective August 8, 2025. The measure includes increased margin requirements of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher) capped at 100%, applicable from August 11, 2025.

## Key Points

- One security (SARDAEN) added to ST-ASM Stage I framework
- Three securities excluded from ASM framework: IPSL, KEN, and VMARCIND
- No securities moved between ASM stages
- Margin rate increase to 50% minimum, capped at 100%
- Surveillance measure is market-driven, not adverse action against company

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of ST-ASM Stage I with specific margin requirements:
- Applicable margin rate: 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher
- Maximum margin rate capped at 100%
- Applied to all open positions as of August 8, 2025
- Applied to new positions created from August 11, 2025

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with increased margin requirements for SARDAEN
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures
- Members should refer to NSE FAQs on Additional Surveillance Measure for detailed guidance

## Important Dates

- **August 8, 2025**: ST-ASM Stage I inclusion effective date
- **August 11, 2025**: Margin requirements implementation date for new positions
- Open positions as of August 8, 2025 subject to new margin rates from August 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The surveillance measure affects trading in Sarda Energy & Minerals Limited through increased margin requirements, potentially reducing speculative activity. The exclusion of three securities (IPSL, KEN, VMARCIND) from ASM framework indicates improved market behavior for these stocks. Overall market impact is limited due to single security inclusion.
