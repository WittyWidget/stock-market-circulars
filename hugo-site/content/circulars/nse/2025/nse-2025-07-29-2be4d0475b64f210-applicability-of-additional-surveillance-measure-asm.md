title: NSE Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) Framework Updates - July 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has updated its Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) Framework effective July 30, 2025. Three securities have been shortlisted for Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I: Solve Plastic Products Limited (BALCO), Sterlite Technologies Limited (STLTECH), and Times Guaranty Limited (TIMESGTY). No securities are being moved between stages or excluded from the framework.

## Key Points

- 3 securities added to Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- No securities in Stage-IV or moving between stages
- No securities being excluded from ASM framework
- Consolidated ASM list shows multiple securities across different stages
- Securities in Stage-IV would be shifted to Trade for Trade (T+3 basis) if applicable

## Regulatory Changes

The ASM framework continues to operate under existing regulations with routine updates to the list of monitored securities. Securities shortlisted under Criteria VII for Stage-IV would be shifted from Rolling Settlement (Series: EQ) to Trade for Trade (Series: BE) on a T+3 basis.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ASM requirements for listed securities
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting for securities under surveillance
- Adherence to position limits and trading restrictions as applicable

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 30, 2025 - ASM framework updates become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The addition of three securities to Stage-I ASM represents routine surveillance activity. This will result in enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions for these securities. Market participants should be aware of increased scrutiny and potential volatility controls for the affected stocks. The impact is moderate as it affects a limited number of securities and represents standard risk management practices.
