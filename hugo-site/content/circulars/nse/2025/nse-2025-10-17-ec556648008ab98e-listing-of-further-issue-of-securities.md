## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative listing notification with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment represents a small increase in Le Merite Exports Limited's outstanding shares (61,400 shares). The 7-month lock-in period until April 2026 means these shares will not be immediately tradable, limiting near-term liquidity impact. As an SME EMERGE platform listing, the impact is confined to the SME segment with no broader market implications.
