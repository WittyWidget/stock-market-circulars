## Summary

- Three categories of members with different limit structures based on net worth
- Higher limits for members with net worth ≥Rs.500 crores
- Separate limits for clearing banks vs other banks
- Limits apply across all segments/schemes

## Regulatory Changes

**Member-wise Bank-wise Limits (Rs in Crores):**
- PCM/Custodian/TM-CM with net worth ≥Rs.500 crores: Other Banks Rs.2800, Clearing Bank Rs.3500
- PCM/Custodian/TM-CM with net worth <Rs.500 crores: Other Banks Rs.1400, Clearing Bank Rs.1750
- Other categories: Other Banks Rs.280, Clearing Bank Rs.350

**Member-wise Limits (Rs in Crores):**
- PCM/Custodian/TM-CM with net worth ≥Rs.500 crores: Rs.14000
- PCM/Custodian/TM-CM with net worth <Rs.500 crores: Rs.7000
- Other categories: Rs.1700

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

This revision provides higher collateral acceptance limits for larger clearing members, potentially improving their operational flexibility. The tiered structure based on net worth ensures proportional risk management while accommodating different member sizes in the commodity derivatives segment.
