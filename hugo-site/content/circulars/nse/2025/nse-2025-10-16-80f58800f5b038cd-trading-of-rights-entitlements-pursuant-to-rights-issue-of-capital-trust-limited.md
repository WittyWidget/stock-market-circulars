## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects existing shareholders of Capital Trust Limited and potential RE investors

**Operational Impact:** 
- Trading members must update systems to recognize new security code CAPTRU-RE1
- Additional compliance burden for contract note disclaimers

**Investor Impact:**
- Existing shareholders receive tradable rights entitlements
- 18-day trading window for renunciation (October 20 - November 06, 2025)

- Investors need clear understanding that REs are different from ordinary shares
