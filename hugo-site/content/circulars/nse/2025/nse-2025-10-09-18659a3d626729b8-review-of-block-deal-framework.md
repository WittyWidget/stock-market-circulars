---

## Summary

SEBI has comprehensively revised the Block Deal Framework through Circular SEBI/HO/MRD/POD-III/CIR/P/2025/134 dated October 08, 2025. The new framework introduces two distinct trading windows - a Morning Block Deal Window (08:45 AM to 09:00 AM) using previous day's closing price as reference, and an Afternoon Block Deal Window (02:05 PM to 02:20 PM) using VWAP calculated from trades between 01:45 PM to 02:00 PM. The minimum order size remains at INR 25 Crores, with orders permitted within +3% of applicable reference prices. These provisions apply to both T+1 and optional T+0 settlement cycles, with implementation effective from the 60th day of circular issuance.

## Key Points

- Two separate block deal windows introduced: Morning (08:45 AM - 09:00 AM) and Afternoon (02:05 PM - 02:20 PM)
- Morning window uses previous day's closing price as reference price
- Afternoon window uses VWAP calculated from cash segment trades between 01:45 PM to 02:00 PM
- Stock exchanges have 15-minute window (02:00 PM to 02:05 PM) to calculate and disseminate VWAP for afternoon session
- Price range restricted to +3% of applicable reference price in respective windows
- Minimum order size maintained at INR 25 Crores per trade
- All trades in block deal windows must result in delivery - no squaring off or reversal permitted
- Stock exchanges must disseminate block deal information (scrip name, client name, quantity, price) to public after market hours on same day
- Framework applies to both T+1 settlement cycle and optional T+0 settlement cycle
- All surveillance, risk containment measures, and trading practices applicable to normal segment extended to block deal windows

**Operational Impact:**
