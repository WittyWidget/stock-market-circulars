title: Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - Long Term Framework Implementation
---

## Summary

NSE has implemented Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) for securities that have satisfied specific criteria. The measure includes 100% margin requirements on all positions and potential shifts from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment for certain securities.

## Key Points

- Long Term ASM framework applied to qualifying securities
- 100% margin requirement on all open and new positions
- Securities under criteria VII will shift from EQ series to BE series (Trade-for-Trade)
- Framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance, not adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of 100% margin rates for ASM securities
- Segment classification changes from Rolling Settlement (EQ) to Trade-for-Trade (BE) for Stage IV securities
- Enhanced surveillance framework building on previous circulars from 2018-2024

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain 100% margin on ASM securities
- Compliance with Trade-for-Trade settlement for reclassified securities
- Adherence to all prevailing surveillance measures
- Monitor ASM FAQ updates on NSE website

## Important Dates

- **August 12, 2025**: Securities shortlisted for Long Term ASM Stage I
- **August 13, 2025**: Last day for existing positions under current margin rates
- **August 14, 2025**: 100% margin requirement effective date
- **August 14, 2025**: Trade-for-Trade segment shift effective date (T+3 basis)

## Impact Assessment

**Stage I Securities Added:**
- Kandarp Digi Smart BPO Limited (KANDARP)
- Sati Poly Plast Limited (SATIPOLY)

**Trading Impact:**
- Significantly increased margin requirements (100%) will reduce leverage and may impact trading volumes
- Trade-for-Trade classification reduces liquidity by eliminating intraday trading
- Higher capital requirements for position holders
- Potential reduction in speculative activity in these securities

**Market Participants:**
- Brokers need to adjust margin collection systems
- Traders must ensure adequate capital for 100% margin requirements
- Institutional investors may face higher funding costs for these positions
