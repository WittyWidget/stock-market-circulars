The suspension applies to lumpsum investments, switch-ins, and fresh registration of Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) and Systematic Transfer Plans (STP). The decision is driven by prevailing market conditions where physical silver shortage in the domestic market has caused silver to trade at a premium relative to international prices, directly impacting the scheme's valuation.
