title: Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Framework Updates - September
  2025
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective September 9, 2025. Thirteen securities have been shortlisted for Stage I of the ST-ASM framework, while one security (Readymix Construction Machinery Limited) has been excluded from the ASM framework as it moved to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework.

## Key Points

- 13 securities added to Short-Term ASM Framework Stage I
- No securities in Stage II of ST-ASM framework
- No securities moving between stages
- One security (READYMIX) excluded from ASM framework due to movement to ESM
- Framework changes effective from September 9, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework has been updated with new security classifications. Securities under ST-ASM are subject to additional surveillance measures including enhanced monitoring of trading patterns and potential trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with additional surveillance requirements for listed securities
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting obligations for securities under ST-ASM
- Adherence to framework-specific trading restrictions and position limits

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: September 9, 2025 - ST-ASM framework updates come into effect

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 13 securities to ST-ASM Stage I will result in enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions for these stocks. This may impact liquidity and trading volumes. The movement of READYMIX from ASM to ESM framework indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny. Investors and traders should exercise increased caution when dealing with these securities and be aware of additional compliance requirements.
