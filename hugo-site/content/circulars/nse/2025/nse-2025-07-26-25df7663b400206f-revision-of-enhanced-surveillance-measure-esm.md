title: NSE Revises Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework for Small-Cap Securities
---

## Summary

NSE has revised the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework applicable to companies with market capitalization below ₹1000 crores. The revision updates both the criteria for shortlisting securities and the stage-wise movement under the framework, while maintaining the same actions for each stage. The new framework becomes effective from July 28, 2025, following a joint surveillance meeting between exchanges and SEBI held on July 25, 2025.

## Key Points

- Revised shortlisting criteria based on High-Low price variation and Close-to-Close price variation over 3, 6, and 12-month periods
- New minimum thresholds: High-Low variation (75%/100%/150%) and Close-to-Close variation (50%/75%/100%)
- Securities with derivative products remain excluded from ESM shortlisting
- Stage I action includes 100% margin from T+2 day and Trade-for-Trade settlement with 5% price band (or 2% if already in 2% band)
- Framework applies in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework has been updated with new quantitative criteria for identifying securities requiring enhanced surveillance:

**Stage 1 Shortlisting Criteria (Either condition must be met):**
1. **High-Low Price Variation** in 3/6/12 months ≥ 1 Standard deviation with minimum thresholds of 75%/100%/150% respectively, AND positive close-to-close price variation over last three months
2. **Close-to-Close Price Variation** in 3/6/12 months ≥ 1 Standard deviation with minimum thresholds of 50%/75%/100% respectively

**Exclusions:** Securities with available derivative products are excluded from shortlisting.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Market Participants:** Must comply with ESM framework alongside other surveillance measures
- **Market Makers:** Required to follow SEBI guidelines and adhere to market making obligations for ESM securities as per specified SEBI circulars
- **NSE Members:** Must implement new margin and settlement requirements for identified securities
- **Securities under Stage I:** Subject to 100% margin and Trade-for-Trade settlement with specified price bands

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** July 25, 2025
- **Effective Date:** July 28, 2025
- **Implementation:** List of shortlisted scrips under amended framework to be published accordingly from effective date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Affects all small-cap companies (market cap < ₹1000 crores) traded on NSE
- Stricter surveillance criteria may reduce speculative trading in volatile small-cap securities
- Higher margin requirements (100%) will increase capital costs for trading these securities

**Operational Impact:**
- Market makers must maintain obligations for ESM securities despite enhanced restrictions
- Trade-for-Trade settlement reduces liquidity but increases transparency
- Price bands (2% or 5%) limit intraday volatility
- Enhanced pre-emptive surveillance aims to protect investor interests and maintain market integrity
