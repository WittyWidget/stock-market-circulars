## Summary

NSE has implemented Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I for four securities effective October 29, 2025. The measure increases margin requirements to 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%, for all open positions and new positions. Additionally, five securities are being excluded from the ASM framework.

## Key Points

- 4 securities added to ST-ASM Stage I: Advance Agrolife Limited (ADVANCE), EPack Prefab Technologies Limited (EPACKPEB), Jain Resource Recycling Limited (JAINREC), and Rite Zone Chemcon India Limited (RITEZONE)
- Margin requirement increased to minimum 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher, capped at 100%
- No securities in ST-ASM Stage II
- No securities moving between stages
- 5 securities excluded from ASM framework: De Neers Tools Limited (DENEERS), GM Breweries Limited (GMBREW), Pentagon Rubber Limited (PENTAGON), Rockingdeals Circular Economy Limited (ROCKINGDCE), and Samay Project Services Limited (SAMAY)
- GM Breweries Limited moved from ST-ASM to LT-ASM framework
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

This circular continues the implementation of the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework previously established through circulars NSE/SURV/39265 (October 27, 2018), NSE/SURV/46557 (December 04, 2020), NSE/SURV/52144 (April 28, 2022), NSE/SURV/58558 (September 25, 2023), and NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024).

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain increased margins of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher) on affected securities
- Margin requirements apply to all open positions as on October 28, 2025
- Margin requirements apply to all new positions created from October 29, 2025
- Maximum margin rate capped at 100%
- Members should refer to NSE FAQs on Additional Surveillance Measure at https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/additional-surveillance-measure

## Important Dates

- **October 28, 2025**: Cut-off date for existing open positions subject to new margin requirements
- **October 29, 2025**: Effective date for margin requirements on all positions (existing and new)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: High - The 50% minimum margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for trading these securities, potentially reducing liquidity and trading volumes.

**Market Participants**: Traders and investors holding positions in the four affected securities (ADVANCE, EPACKPEB, JAINREC, RITEZONE) will face substantially higher margin obligations, requiring additional capital or position reduction.
