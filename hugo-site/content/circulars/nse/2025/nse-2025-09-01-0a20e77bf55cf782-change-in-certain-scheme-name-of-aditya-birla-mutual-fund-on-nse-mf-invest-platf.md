- Feature implemented on NSE MF Invest platform with immediate effect

- All other terms and conditions of the schemes remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes - this is an operational platform enhancement to provide additional investment frequency options for existing mutual fund schemes.

- No specific compliance actions required beyond awareness of the new feature

## Important Dates
