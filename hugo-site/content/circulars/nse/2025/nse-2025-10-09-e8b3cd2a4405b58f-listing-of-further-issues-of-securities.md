**Operational Impact**: None for general market participants. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new share count and distinctive number ranges.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in free float due to small quantities involved. The largest allotment is 96,554 shares for ICICI Lombard, which is minimal relative to typical trading volumes.
