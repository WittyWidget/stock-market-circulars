title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Two Securities Added to Stage I
---

## Summary

NSE has imposed Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Stage I on two securities - Newjaisa Technologies Limited (NEWJAISA) and PVP Ventures Limited (PVP). These securities will attract minimum 100% margin requirements and shift from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade segment effective September 12, 2025.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to ESM Stage I: NEWJAISA and PVP
- 100% minimum margin requirement on all open and new positions
- Securities will shift from EQ/SM series to BE/ST series (trade-for-trade)
- No securities being excluded from ESM framework
- No securities moving between ESM stages
- ESM is a market surveillance measure, not adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

- Securities under ESM Stage I will move from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST)
- Securities moving to Stage II will be under Trade for Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain minimum 100% margin for affected securities
- All open positions as of September 11, 2025 will be subject to new margin requirements
- New positions created from September 12, 2025 onwards will attract 100% margin
- Trading will only be possible in trade-for-trade mode for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **September 11, 2025**: Last day for existing positions under current margin requirements
- **September 12, 2025**: ESM Stage I becomes effective for NEWJAISA and PVP
- **September 12, 2025**: Securities shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST series

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: High - Securities will face restricted trading through trade-for-trade mechanism only, potentially reducing liquidity and increasing transaction costs.

**Margin Impact**: High - 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital requirements for positions in these securities.

**Market Access**: Medium - Retail and institutional investors will face higher barriers to trading these securities due to margin and settlement restrictions.
