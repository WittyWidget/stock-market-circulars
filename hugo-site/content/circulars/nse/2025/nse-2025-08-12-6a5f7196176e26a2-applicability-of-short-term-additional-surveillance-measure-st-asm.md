## Summary

NSE implements Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I for PG Electroplast Limited (PGEL) effective August 13, 2025. The measure imposes higher margin requirements of 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher, capped at 100%. Two securities - Prostarm Info Systems Limited and Safe Enterprises Retail Fixtures Limited - are being excluded from the ASM framework.

## Key Points

- ST-ASM Stage I applied to PGEL (INE457L01029) effective August 13, 2025
- Margin requirement increased to 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher
- Maximum margin rate capped at 100%
- Two securities excluded from ASM framework: PROSTARM and SAFEENTP
- No securities moved between ST-ASM stages
- Consolidated ASM list includes multiple securities across different stages

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework with enhanced margin requirements for securities meeting specific surveillance criteria. The framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures imposed by exchanges.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must apply 50% margin or existing margin (whichever higher) for PGEL
- Margin requirements apply to all open positions as of August 13, 2025
- New positions from August 14, 2025 subject to enhanced margin requirements
- Members must monitor and comply with ASM framework provisions

## Important Dates

- August 13, 2025: ST-ASM Stage I effective date for PGEL
- August 14, 2025: Enhanced margin requirements apply to new positions
- August 13, 2025: Exclusion of PROSTARM and SAFEENTP from ASM framework

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on affected securities and market participants. Higher margin requirements may reduce speculative trading activity in PGEL. Exclusion of two securities from ASM framework provides relief to those market segments. The measure is purely surveillance-based and should not be construed as adverse action against companies. Overall market impact limited to specific securities under surveillance.
