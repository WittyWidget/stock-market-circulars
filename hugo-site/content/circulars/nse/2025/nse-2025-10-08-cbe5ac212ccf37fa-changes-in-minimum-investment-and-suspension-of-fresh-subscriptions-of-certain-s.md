**Subscription Suspension (Effective October 7, 2025):**

- Applications received post cutoff timing on effective date will not be processed

## Compliance Requirements

**For NSE Members:**
- Take note of the changes on NSE MF Invest Platform
- Inform investors about suspension of fresh subscriptions for affected schemes
- Process only existing SIP/STP installments registered prior to effective date

**For Investors:**
- Fresh subscription applications for certain Birla Sun Life schemes will not be accepted from October 7, 2025 onwards
- New SIP/STP registrations will not be processed for effective date or later
- Existing SIP/STP commitments made before effective date will continue to be honored
- Lower minimum amounts available for Daily SIP and Liquid Fund investments

## Important Dates

- **October 7, 2025**: Effective date for suspension of fresh subscriptions/switch-ins; applications received post cutoff will not be processed
- **October 8, 2025**: Effective date for Daily SIP modifications and Liquid Fund minimum application amount changes

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects only investors using NSE MF Invest Platform for Birla Sun Life/Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund schemes. Suspension suggests possible capacity constraints or strategic decisions by the fund house.

**Investor Impact:** Existing investors with registered SIP/STP can continue their investments, but new investors cannot make fresh subscriptions in the affected schemes. The reduction in minimum amounts for Daily SIP and Liquid Fund makes these more accessible for small investors.

**Operational Impact:** NSE platform will stop accepting new applications for specified schemes while continuing to process existing systematic investment commitments. The lower Daily SIP threshold (Rs. 10) significantly improves accessibility for retail investors in continuing schemes.
