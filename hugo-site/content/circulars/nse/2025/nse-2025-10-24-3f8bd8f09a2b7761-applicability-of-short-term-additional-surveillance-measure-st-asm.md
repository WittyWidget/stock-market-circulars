## Summary

NSE has issued circular NSE/SURV/70950 (Ref: 821/2025) announcing the applicability of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective October 27, 2025. Three new securities have been added to ST-ASM Stage I (Bhageria Industries Limited, Divyadhan Recycling Industries Limited, and Electro Force (India) Limited). The consolidated list now contains 30 securities under ST-ASM Stage I framework. No securities are currently in Stage II, and no securities are being excluded from the framework.

## Key Points

- Three securities added to ST-ASM Stage I: BHAGERIA (INE354C01027), DIVYADHAN (INE0QYI01019), EFORCE (INE0Q1W01012)
- No securities in ST-ASM Stage II
- No securities moving between stages
- No securities being excluded from ASM framework
- Total of 30 securities now under ST-ASM Stage I surveillance
- Consolidated list includes securities from various sectors with enhanced monitoring

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or volatility. Stage I measures typically include:

- Reduction in price bands (typically 5% or lower)
- 100% upfront margin requirement from clients
- Delivery-based settlement only (no intraday trading)
- Additional disclosure requirements for trading members

Securities can progress to Stage II if unusual activity continues, which involves more stringent restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must collect 100% upfront margins from clients for transactions in listed securities
- Only delivery-based trading permitted (no intraday squaring off)
- Members must ensure compliance with reduced price band limits
- Enhanced reporting and monitoring obligations for transactions in these securities
- Clients must have adequate funds/securities before order placement

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 24, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 27, 2025 (measures come into force)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects liquidity and trading activity in 30 securities, with three new additions to the surveillance framework.

**Trading Impact**: Traders and investors in these securities will face:
- Reduced intraday trading opportunities (delivery-only settlement)
- Higher capital requirements (100% upfront margin)
- Limited price movement within narrow bands
- Reduced liquidity due to stricter trading conditions

**Investor Impact**: The surveillance measures aim to protect investors from excessive volatility and potential manipulation, though they may reduce trading flexibility and liquidity in affected securities.
