## Summary

NSE has implemented enhanced risk monitoring measures for equity derivatives trading, introducing delta-neutral position calculations and penalty structures for violations. The circular provides detailed scenarios showing how Future Equivalent (FutEq) positions are calculated and monitored, with penalties of ₹5,000 applied for violations exceeding tolerance limits.

## Key Points

- Introduction of delta-neutral position monitoring using contract delta calculations
- Future Equivalent (FutEq) positions calculated based on 2:00 PM SPAN file data
- Penalty structure of ₹5,000 for violations exceeding acceptable tolerance levels
- Position revision mechanisms for maintaining compliance
- Multiple scenarios covering futures and options combinations
- Real-time monitoring of base positions vs end-of-day positions

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of automated delta calculation system using SPAN file data
- Introduction of violation detection mechanism for position limits
- Establishment of penalty framework for non-compliance
- Enhanced position monitoring across different expiry dates
- Revised calculation methodology for future equivalent positions

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must maintain delta-neutral positions within specified tolerance limits
- Regular monitoring of Future Equivalent positions against base positions
- Immediate position adjustments required when violations are detected
- Payment of penalties for positions exceeding violation thresholds
- Compliance with revised position calculation methodology

## Important Dates

- Implementation effective from the date of circular issuance
- Daily monitoring using 2:00 PM SPAN file data
- Real-time position tracking and violation detection

## Impact Assessment

- Increased compliance burden on derivatives traders and trading members
- Enhanced risk management through systematic position monitoring
- Potential impact on complex derivatives trading strategies
- Improved market stability through better risk controls
- Financial impact through penalty structure for non-compliance
- Need for system upgrades to handle new calculation requirements
