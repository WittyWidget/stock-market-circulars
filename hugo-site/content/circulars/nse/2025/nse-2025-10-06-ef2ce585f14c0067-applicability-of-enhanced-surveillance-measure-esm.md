title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Securities Shortlisted for Stages I and
  II
---

## Summary

NSE has announced the applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective October 07, 2025. Four securities are being newly shortlisted into ESM Stage-I: ATLANTAA Limited, Cybertech Systems And Software Limited, Jeyyam Global Foods Limited, and Taurian MPS Limited. Additionally, these four stocks will move from EQ/SM to BE/ST trading segment effective October 08, 2025. The consolidated ESM list includes 27 securities in Stage-II and multiple securities in Stage-I.

## Key Points

- 4 new securities added to ESM Stage-I effective October 07, 2025
- ATLANTAA, CYBERTECH, JEYYAM, and TAURIAN will shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST segment on October 08, 2025
- No securities moving from Stage-I to Stage-II
- No securities moving from Stage-II to Stage-I
- No securities excluded from ESM framework
- Total of 27 securities currently in ESM Stage-II
- ESM Stage-I includes stocks like AARADHYA, AARVEEDEN, ABHAPOWER, ACCENTMIC, AGNI, AGROPHOS and others

## Regulatory Changes

Securities under ESM are subject to enhanced surveillance due to concerns around price volatility, market integrity, or other risk factors. The framework operates in two stages with progressively stricter monitoring and trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the segment change for 4 securities from EQ/SM to BE/ST effective October 08, 2025
- Trading in ESM securities subject to additional surveillance measures including price bands, trade-for-trade settlement, and periodic call auctions
- Investors should exercise additional caution when trading in ESM-listed securities

## Important Dates

- **October 07, 2025**: ESM Stage-I applicability for ATLANTAA, CYBERTECH, JEYYAM, and TAURIAN
- **October 08, 2025**: Trading segment change from EQ/SM to BE/ST for the above 4 securities

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of securities in ESM Stage-I indicates regulatory concerns about trading patterns or corporate governance issues. The segment change to BE/ST (trade-for-trade segment with no intraday trading) significantly reduces liquidity and impacts short-term trading strategies. Investors holding or trading these securities face increased restrictions and should reassess their positions. The measure aims to protect market integrity and investor interests by imposing stricter oversight on securities showing abnormal market behavior.
