title: KYC Validation Deadline - Trading Restrictions for Non-Validated Clients from
  October 25, 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has issued guidelines regarding KYC validation requirements following SEBI amendments to KRA Regulations, 2011. Clients whose KYC records uploaded to KRAs between September 1-30, 2025 remain 'On Hold' (not validated) will face trading restrictions from October 25, 2025. Affected clients will be unable to execute new trades or square up existing positions until their KYC is validated. Trading members must access non-compliant client lists through the NSE member portal and ensure compliance.

## Key Points

- Clients with 'On Hold' KYC status (both Aadhaar and Non-Aadhaar based OVD) uploaded September 1-30, 2025 will be restricted from trading
- Trading restrictions effective from October 25, 2025
- Restricted clients cannot execute new trades or square up open positions
- Open positions will naturally expire on respective contract expiry dates
- NSE will flag non-compliant PANs as 'Not Permitted to Trade' from October 25, 2025
- Clients achieving KRA compliance will be permitted to trade on T+1 basis
- KRA shares demise data daily; trading members must block debit transactions and suspend trading accounts for deceased investors
- Non-compliant client lists available on NSE member portal under ENIT > Log > Downloads

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements ongoing compliance with:
- SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/MIRSD/FATF/P/CIR/2023/0144 dated August 11, 2023
- SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/OIAE/OIAE_IAD-1/P/CIR/2023/0000000163 dated October 03, 2023 on centralized mechanism for reporting investor demise
- Previous NSE Circular NSE/ISC/70132 dated September 10, 2025
- Amendments to SEBI KYC Registration Agency (KRA) Regulations, 2011

The regulations mandate strict validation requirements for all KYC records and establish a centralized demise reporting mechanism through KRAs.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**

**Operational Impact:**

- Need for daily monitoring of KRA compliance status updates
- Process integration required for handling deceased investor data from KRA

**Compliance Impact:**
- Strengthens KYC validation framework and investor protection
- Enforces stricter adherence to SEBI KRA regulations
- Reduces risk of non-compliant trading activity
- Improves accuracy of investor records through mandatory validation

**Client Impact:**
- High severity for affected clients unable to trade or manage positions
- Urgent action required from clients with pending KYC validation
- Risk of forced position expiry for non-compliant clients with open positions
