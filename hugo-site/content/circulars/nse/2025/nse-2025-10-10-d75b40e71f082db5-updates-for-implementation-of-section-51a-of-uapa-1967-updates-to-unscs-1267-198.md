## Important Dates

- **October 6, 2025**: Effective date of amendments to sanctions list entries
- **October 10, 2025**: NSE circular issuance date

## Impact Assessment

**Compliance Impact**: High - Mandatory compliance required under UAPA, 1967 and UNSC resolutions. Non-compliance can result in severe penalties.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium - Requires updating of sanctions screening systems and databases with amended entries. Financial institutions and market intermediaries must ensure their screening tools reflect these changes.

**Market Impact**: Low - These specific individuals have limited direct connection to Indian securities markets. One is reportedly deceased (2012) and the other is imprisoned in Indonesia.

**Risk Assessment**: Market participants must maintain robust sanctions screening processes. The circular emphasizes India's commitment to international counter-terrorism financing obligations and implementation of UN Security Council sanctions.
