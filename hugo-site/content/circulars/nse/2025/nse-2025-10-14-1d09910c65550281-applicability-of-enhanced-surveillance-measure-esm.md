## Summary

NSE has issued Circular No. 798/2025 updating the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework. Trust Fintech Limited (Symbol: TRUST, ISIN: INE0SWN01019) has been added to ESM Stage I effective October 15, 2025. The security will shift from Rolling Settlement segment (EQ/SM series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series) on October 16, 2025, with a minimum 100% margin requirement on all open and new positions.

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework continues to operate in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures imposed by NSE. The shortlisting is purely for market surveillance purposes and should not be construed as adverse action against the company. This circular references previous circulars NSE/SURV/56948 (June 02, 2023), NSE/SURV/57609 (July 18, 2023), NSE/SURV/63361 (August 09, 2024), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), NSE/SURV/64400 (October 04, 2024), and NSE/SURV/69315 (July 25, 2025).

## Important Dates

- **October 14, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 15, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes applicable on all open positions; securities shifting to Stage II move to Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band
- **October 16, 2025**: 100% margin requirement applies to new positions; Trust Fintech Limited shifts from EQ/SM to BE/ST segment; ESM changes become fully effective

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Trust Fintech Limited**: The addition to ESM Stage I significantly impacts trading in Trust Fintech Limited shares. The 100% margin requirement substantially increases capital requirements for traders and investors holding positions. The shift to Trade-for-Trade segment eliminates intraday trading opportunities and requires mandatory delivery of shares, severely restricting liquidity. These measures are designed to curb excessive speculation and volatility but will likely result in reduced trading volumes and wider bid-ask spreads. Existing position holders must arrange for full margin by October 15, 2025, or risk forced square-off. The surveillance action, while not punitive to the company itself, signals heightened regulatory scrutiny of the security's trading patterns.
