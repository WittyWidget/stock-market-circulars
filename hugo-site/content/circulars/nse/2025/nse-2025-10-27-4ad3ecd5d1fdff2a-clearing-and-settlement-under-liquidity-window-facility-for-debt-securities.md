- **October 24, 2025**: NSE issued operating guidelines (circular NSE/DS/70953)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
The introduction of the Liquidity Window Facility represents a significant structural change in the debt securities market, providing investors with a standardized exchange-based mechanism to exercise put options. This enhances liquidity and transparency in the debt market by making redemption data publicly visible throughout the trading session.

**Operational Impact:**
All market participants including clearing members, brokers, issuers, depositories, and RTAs will need to adapt their systems and processes to comply with the new framework. The mandatory early pay-in requirement through block mechanism necessitates integration between trading and depository systems. The facility for handling multiple ISINs simultaneously adds complexity to depository operations.

**Investor Impact:**
Investors gain improved access to liquidity through a transparent, exchange-based mechanism for exercising put options. The mandatory blocking of securities before bidding provides certainty of settlement but requires advance planning. Extended trading hours (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM with additional 30 minutes on last day) provide flexibility for participation.

**Issuer Impact:**
Issuers must establish relationships with RTAs and clearing members, and make decisions about which stock exchanges to use for their liquidity windows. The real-time visibility of cumulative redemption requests helps issuers manage their liquidity planning more effectively.
