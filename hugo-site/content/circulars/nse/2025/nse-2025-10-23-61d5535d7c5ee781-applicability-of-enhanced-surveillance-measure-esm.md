## Summary

NSE has issued updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework, adding 4 securities to ESM Stage-I and moving 2 securities from Stage-I to Stage-II. The affected securities will face a minimum 100% margin requirement and will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment to Trade-for-Trade segment. Securities moving to Stage-II will additionally be placed under Periodic Call Auction with a 2% price band.

## Key Points

- 4 securities added to ESM Stage-I: Mayasheel Ventures Limited, Sharp Chucks and Machines Limited, Sejal Glass Limited, and Xelpmoc Design And Tech Limited
- 2 securities moved from ESM Stage-I to Stage-II: Mcleod Russel India Limited and S.A.L. Steel Limited
- No securities excluded from ESM framework
- No securities moved from Stage-II to Stage-I
- 100% margin requirement applies on all open positions and new positions
- Securities will shift from EQ/SM series to BE/ST series (Trade-for-Trade)
- Stage-II securities will be under Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

Securities qualifying under ESM Stage-I will be shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST). Stage-II securities will additionally face restrictions under Periodic Call Auction mechanism with a 2% price band limitation.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure compliance with 100% margin requirement for affected securities
- Margins apply to both existing open positions as on October 24, 2025, and new positions created from October 27, 2025
- Trading members must adapt to Trade-for-Trade settlement mechanism for listed securities
- For Stage-II securities, trading will be restricted to Periodic Call Auction sessions only

## Important Dates

- **October 23, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 24, 2025**: Stage-II securities come under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction; 100% margin applies on open positions
- **October 27, 2025**: Stage-I securities shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST series; 100% margin applies on new positions

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact**: The imposition of 100% margin requirements significantly reduces leverage availability for traders in these securities. The shift to Trade-for-Trade segment eliminates intraday trading opportunities and requires full upfront capital for transactions. For Stage-II securities (MCLEODRUSS and SALSTEEL), the additional Periodic Call Auction restriction with 2% price band severely limits liquidity and price discovery mechanisms. These measures are likely to result in reduced trading volumes, wider bid-ask spreads, and potential price volatility in affected securities. Investors holding these securities should note that these are surveillance measures and not adverse actions against the companies themselves.
