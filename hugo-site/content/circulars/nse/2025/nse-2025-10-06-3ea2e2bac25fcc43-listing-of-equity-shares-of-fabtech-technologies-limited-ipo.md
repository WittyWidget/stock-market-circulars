## Impact Assessment

This listing adds a new trading instrument to the NSE Capital Market segment. The IPO pricing at Rs. 191 per share represents a significant premium to face value (19.1x). With approximately 27% of shares (12,058,555) available for immediate trading and the remainder under lock-in, initial liquidity may be moderate. Impact is primarily relevant to IPO investors and those interested in the company's sector. The shift from BE to EQ series will follow standard SEBI protocols for new listings.
