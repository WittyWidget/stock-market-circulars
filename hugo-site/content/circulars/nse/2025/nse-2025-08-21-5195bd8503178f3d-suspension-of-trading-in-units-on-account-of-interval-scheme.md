title: Suspension of Trading in Aditya Birla Mutual Fund Interval Schemes
---

## Summary

NSE has announced the temporary suspension of trading in four Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund interval schemes effective August 22, 2025, at closing hours of trading on August 21, 2025. The suspension is due to the closure of the Specified Transaction Period (STP) for these interval schemes.

## Key Points

- Four Aditya Birla Sun Life interval fund schemes will be suspended from trading
- Suspension becomes effective from August 22, 2025
- All suspended schemes are quarterly interval funds with different plan variants
- Trading suspension follows standard procedure for interval scheme closures
- Revival of trading depends on AMC confirmation of scheme continuation post-STP closure

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This action is taken under existing Regulation 3.1.2 of the National Stock Exchange (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A.

## Compliance Requirements

- Asset Management Company (AMC) must confirm continuation of schemes post closure of Specified Transaction Period
- Members must ensure compliance with trading suspension effective August 22, 2025
- No trading orders should be placed for the specified scheme symbols during suspension period

## Important Dates

- **August 21, 2025**: Last trading day - suspension effective at closing hours
- **August 22, 2025**: Trading suspension begins
- **TBD**: Trading revival subject to AMC confirmation of scheme continuation

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on investors holding these specific interval fund units. The suspension is temporary and follows standard interval scheme operations. Investors cannot trade these units during the suspension period but can resume trading once AMC confirms scheme continuation and NSE revokes the suspension.
