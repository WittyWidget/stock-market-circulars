title: NSE Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework Updates - July 2025
---

## Summary

NSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework, adding new securities and transitioning others between stages. The changes include minimum 100% margin requirements, shifts from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade segments, and implementation of periodic call auction with 2% price bands for Stage II securities.

## Key Points

- United Polyfab Gujarat Limited (UNITEDPOLY) added to ESM Stage I with 100% margin requirement
- GP Eco Solutions India Limited (GPECO) moved from Stage I to Stage II
- Securities in ESM will shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST)
- Stage II securities will have 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- No securities excluded from ESM framework in this update
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Enhanced margin requirements of minimum 100% for ESM securities
- Segment classification changes from EQ/SM to BE/ST for affected securities
- Implementation of Periodic Call Auction mechanism for Stage II securities
- Price band restriction of 2% for Stage II securities

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure compliance with 100% margin requirements for ESM securities
- Trading members must adapt to trade-for-trade segment operations for affected securities
- Participants should monitor the consolidated ESM list for ongoing compliance
- Regular review of surveillance measures and framework updates required

## Important Dates

- **July 30, 2025**: ESM Stage transitions and exclusions effective
- **July 30, 2025**: Stage II securities move to Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band
- **July 31, 2025**: 100% margin requirement effective on all open and new positions
- **July 31, 2025**: Securities shift from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ESM will experience reduced liquidity due to trade-for-trade mechanism and higher margin requirements. The 2% price band for Stage II securities will limit price volatility but may affect price discovery.

**Market Participants**: Increased capital requirements due to 100% margin and operational adjustments needed for trade-for-trade settlement. Enhanced monitoring and compliance procedures required.

**Investor Impact**: Limited trading flexibility and potentially higher transaction costs for affected securities. Investors should review positions in ESM securities before implementation dates.
