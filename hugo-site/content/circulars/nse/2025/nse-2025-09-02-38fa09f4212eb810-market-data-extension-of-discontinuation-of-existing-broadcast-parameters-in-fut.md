title: Market Data - Extension of Discontinuation of Existing Broadcast Parameters
  in F&O Segment
---

## Summary

NSE has extended the discontinuation date for existing market data broadcast parameters in the Futures & Options segment to October 4, 2025. This extension applies to members using NNF (Near-to-Far) who are receiving 5-depth 1-second refresh market data. The Exchange emphasizes this will be the final extension and members must complete their migration to new broadcast parameters before the deadline.

## Key Points

- Discontinuation of existing NNF market data broadcast parameters extended to October 4, 2025 (mock environment)
- Affects members using 5-depth 1-second refresh market data feeds
- New broadcast parameters for Ticker, Market Index, Market Watch, Bhavcopy, and Underlying Open Interest have been live since July 21, 2025
- Coexistence phase allows receiving broadcast from both existing and new parameters
- No further extensions will be granted beyond October 4, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The Exchange has introduced enhanced market data dissemination through new transcodes with improved parameters. Members are required to migrate from existing broadcast parameters to the new system specifications introduced in July 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members using NNF must ensure readiness of their migration plan before October 4, 2025
- Members must implement and maintain redundancy for market data broadcast subscriptions
- Infrastructure and systems must be adequately sized for new broadcast feeds
- Members are solely responsible for managing disconnection, bandwidth utilization, and latency issues

## Important Dates

- **July 21, 2025**: New broadcast parameters went live
- **October 4, 2025**: Final discontinuation date for existing market data broadcast parameters (mock environment)

## Impact Assessment

The extension provides additional time for members to complete their technical migration to new broadcast parameters. Members who fail to migrate by the deadline will lose access to market data through existing parameters. The change primarily affects technical infrastructure with no direct trading impact, though inadequate preparation could disrupt member operations relying on market data feeds.
