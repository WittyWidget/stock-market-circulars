## Impact Assessment

The listing of these further issues has minimal market-wide impact as both companies operate on the SME EMERGE platform, which caters to small and medium enterprises. The addition of 3.3 million shares for Felix Industries represents a material dilution for existing shareholders, while Viviana's 51,500 shares represent a smaller increase. The extended lock-in periods (ranging from 8 months to 20 months for Felix, and 19 months for Viviana) will restrict immediate liquidity of these newly listed shares. Investors should note the preferential allotment nature of these issues, which typically indicates strategic investments or promoter-related transactions. The securities are pari passu with existing shares, ensuring equal voting and dividend rights.
