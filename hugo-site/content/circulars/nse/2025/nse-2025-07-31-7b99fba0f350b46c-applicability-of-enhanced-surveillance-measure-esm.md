title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Updates - Securities Added and Margin Requirements
---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework, adding two securities to Stage I with enhanced margin requirements. The affected securities will face a minimum 100% margin requirement and be shifted from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to ESM Stage I: Chandan Healthcare Limited (CHANDAN) and Omax Autos Limited (OMAXAUTO)
- 100% minimum margin requirement applicable on all open and new positions
- Securities will shift from EQ/SM series to BE/ST series (Trade-for-Trade)
- No securities are being removed from the ESM framework
- No movement between Stage I and Stage II
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Enhanced margin requirements: minimum 100% margin on affected securities
- Segment shift: from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade (BE/ST)
- Stage II securities operate under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure compliance with 100% margin requirements
- Brokers and members must adjust systems for segment changes
- Positions must comply with new margin requirements from effective dates

## Important Dates

- **August 1, 2025**: ESM Stage I inclusion effective for margin requirements on existing positions
- **August 4, 2025**: Segment shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST effective; 100% margin on new positions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to two specific securities with enhanced surveillance requirements. The 100% margin requirement will significantly increase capital requirements for trading these stocks, likely reducing speculative activity. The shift to Trade-for-Trade segment will eliminate intraday trading opportunities, focusing on delivery-based transactions only.
