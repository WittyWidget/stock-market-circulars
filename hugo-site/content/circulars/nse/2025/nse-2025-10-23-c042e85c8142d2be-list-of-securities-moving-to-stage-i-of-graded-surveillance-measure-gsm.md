## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The 100% margin requirement will significantly reduce leverage availability for traders, potentially reducing trading volumes and liquidity in ORTEL Communications Limited. The 5% price band restriction limits intraday price volatility.

**Investor Impact**: Existing investors may face reduced liquidity when attempting to exit positions. New investors must commit full capital upfront with no margin benefits.

**Market Signal**: Placement in GSM Stage I indicates heightened surveillance concerns and serves as a warning to market participants about elevated risks associated with this security.

**Progression Risk**: If underlying concerns persist, the security may progress to Stage II (Trade-for-Trade with 50% ASD), Stage III (weekly trading with 100% ASD), or Stage IV (weekly trading with 100% ASD and no upward movement).
