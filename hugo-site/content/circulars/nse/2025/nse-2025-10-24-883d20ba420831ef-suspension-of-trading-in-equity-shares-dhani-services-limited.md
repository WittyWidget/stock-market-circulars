## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has issued a circular suspending trading in the equity shares of Dhani Services Limited (Symbol: DHANI, Series: EQ) effective from October 28, 2025 (closing hours of October 27, 2025). The suspension is being implemented pursuant to Regulation 3.1.2 of the National Stock Exchange (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A, due to a scheme of amalgamation involving the company.

## Key Points

- Trading in Dhani Services Limited equity shares will be suspended from October 28, 2025
- The suspension applies to the EQ (equity) series
- Stock symbol: DHANI
- Reason: Scheme of Amalgamation
- Regulatory basis: NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A, Regulation 3.1.2
- Circular reference: NSE/CML/70948, dated October 24, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements a trading suspension under existing NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A, specifically Regulation 3.1.2, which provides for suspension of trading in securities under specified circumstances including corporate restructuring.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must cease trading in DHANI equity shares from the effective date
- No buy or sell orders for DHANI will be executed on NSE from October 28, 2025 onwards
- Members should inform their clients holding or interested in trading DHANI shares about this suspension
- Existing positions and holdings remain unaffected; only trading activity is suspended

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: October 24, 2025
- **Last Trading Day**: October 27, 2025 (until closing hours)
- **Suspension Effective Date**: October 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete halt of trading activity in DHANI shares on NSE prevents price discovery and liquidity for existing shareholders. Investors will be unable to enter or exit positions during the suspension period.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders of Dhani Services Limited will not be able to trade their holdings on NSE from October 28, 2025. The amalgamation scheme suggests a corporate restructuring that may result in share exchange or other consideration for existing shareholders as per the scheme terms.

**Operational Impact**: The suspension is linked to a scheme of amalgamation, indicating that the company is undergoing merger or consolidation with another entity. Trading will likely resume only after the amalgamation process is completed and new securities (if any) are listed, or the scheme is withdrawn/rejected.
