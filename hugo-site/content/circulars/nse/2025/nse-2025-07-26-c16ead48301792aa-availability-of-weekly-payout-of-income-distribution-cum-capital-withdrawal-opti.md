## Summary

Mirae Asset Mutual Fund has introduced a Weekly Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) payout option for the Mirae Asset Liquid Fund, effective July 28, 2025. This addition provides investors with more frequent payout options alongside existing daily, monthly, and reinvestment alternatives.

## Key Points

- New weekly IDCW payout option added to Mirae Asset Liquid Fund
- Applies to both Regular and Direct plans
- Weekly distributions will be declared every Wednesday as record date
- Existing daily and monthly payout options remain unchanged
- All reinvestment options (daily, weekly, monthly) continue to be available

## Regulatory Changes

- Updated Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)
- Modified Plans and Options section to include weekly payout facility
- Enhanced IDCW option structure with additional sub-options

## Compliance Requirements

- Mirae Asset Investment Managers must update all scheme documentation
- SID and KIM amendments must reflect the new weekly payout option
- Proper disclosure of the new option to existing and prospective investors

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 28, 2025
- **Record Date**: Every Wednesday for weekly IDCW declarations

## Impact Assessment

Limited impact as this is a product enhancement specific to one mutual fund scheme. Provides greater flexibility for investors seeking regular income from liquid fund investments but does not affect broader market operations or trading activities.
