## Impact Assessment

This is a company-specific listing event with minimal market impact. The rights issue increases the outstanding shares of Shradha Infraprojects Limited by 30.37 million shares. Existing shareholders who participated in the rights issue will see their holdings credited. The dilution impact depends on the participation rate, but since these are rights shares offered to existing shareholders, the proportional ownership remains largely unchanged for those who subscribed. Trading liquidity may increase marginally due to the expanded share base.
