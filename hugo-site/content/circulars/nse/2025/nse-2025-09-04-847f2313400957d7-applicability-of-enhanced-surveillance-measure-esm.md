title: Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - September 2025 Updates
---

## Summary

NSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework with securities movements between different stages. Two securities (A2ZINFRA and IEL) are moving from Stage I to Stage II, while securities under ESM will shift from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment with 100% minimum margin requirements.

## Key Points

- No new securities added to ESM Stage I
- A2Z Infra Engineering Limited and Indiabulls Enterprises Limited moving from Stage I to Stage II
- No securities excluded from ESM framework
- Securities shifting to Stage II will be under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- 100% minimum margin applicable on all open and new positions

## Regulatory Changes

- Securities under ESM shifted from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST)
- Stage II securities subject to Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Enhanced margin requirements of minimum 100% on all positions

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with 100% minimum margin requirements
- All open positions as on September 5, 2025 subject to enhanced margin
- New positions from September 8, 2025 onwards subject to margin requirements
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **September 5, 2025**: Stage movements effective, Trade-for-Trade with price band begins for Stage II securities
- **September 8, 2025**: Trade-for-Trade segment shift effective, 100% margin requirement begins

## Impact Assessment

- Limited impact affecting specific securities under surveillance
- Increased trading costs due to 100% margin requirements
- Reduced liquidity for affected securities due to Trade-for-Trade mechanism
- Price discovery constraints due to 2% price band for Stage II securities
- Purely surveillance-driven measure, not adverse action against companies
