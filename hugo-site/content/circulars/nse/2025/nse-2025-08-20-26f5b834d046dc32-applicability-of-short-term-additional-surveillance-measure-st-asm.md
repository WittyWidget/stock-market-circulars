## Summary

NSE has implemented Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I on three securities effective August 22, 2025. The measure imposes a minimum 50% margin requirement on these securities due to market surveillance criteria being satisfied.

## Key Points

- Three securities shortlisted under ST-ASM Stage I: Brightcom Group Limited (BCG), Shanthala FMCG Products Limited (SHANTHALA), and Signpost India Limited (SIGNPOST)
- Margin rate of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher) applicable, capped at maximum 100%
- Two securities excluded from ASM framework: Iware Supplychain Services Limited and Namo eWaste Management Limited
- Surveillance measure is market-driven and should not be construed as adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework with graduated margin requirements based on surveillance criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain minimum 50% margin on ST-ASM securities
- Margin requirements apply to all open positions as of August 21, 2025 and new positions from August 22, 2025
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **August 21, 2025**: Cut-off date for existing positions
- **August 22, 2025**: Effective date for ST-ASM implementation and margin requirements

## Impact Assessment

Increased margin requirements will affect trading liquidity and cost of carry for the three affected securities. Market participants holding positions in BCG, SHANTHALA, and SIGNPOST will need to maintain higher margins, potentially impacting trading volumes and volatility in these stocks.
