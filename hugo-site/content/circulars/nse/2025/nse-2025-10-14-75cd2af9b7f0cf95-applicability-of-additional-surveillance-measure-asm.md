title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - Long-Term Framework
  Updates
---

## Summary

NSE has issued an update on the Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) Framework effective October 15, 2025. Diensten Tech Limited (DTL, ISIN: INE0JRD01019) has been shortlisted for inclusion in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I. No securities are moving between stages, being excluded from the framework, or placed in Stage-IV during this cycle. The circular includes a consolidated list of all securities currently under the ASM Framework across various stages.

## Key Points

- One new security added to Long-Term ASM Stage-I: Diensten Tech Limited (Symbol: DTL, ISIN: INE0JRD01019)
- No securities shortlisted for Stage-IV placement
- No movement of securities between ASM stages (I to II, II to III, III to IV, or reverse movements)
- No securities excluded from ASM Framework in this update
- Consolidated ASM list includes securities across Stage-I and Stage-IV, with multiple companies under ongoing surveillance
- Securities in Stage-IV under Criteria VII are shifted from Rolling Settlement (Series: EQ) to Trade for Trade (Series: BE) on T+3 basis

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. The circular implements existing Long-Term ASM Framework provisions to enhance market surveillance and protect investor interests. The ASM Framework continues to apply stricter surveillance measures on securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or volatility patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the inclusion of Diensten Tech Limited in ASM Stage-I and apply appropriate surveillance protocols
- Enhanced monitoring required for all securities listed in the consolidated ASM list
- Members must ensure clients are informed about ASM applicability on affected securities
- Price bands, trade-for-trade settlement, and other ASM-specific restrictions apply as per stage-wise framework guidelines
- Securities in Stage-IV (Criteria VII) must be traded on Trade for Trade basis in BE series instead of Rolling Settlement

## Important Dates

- **October 15, 2025**: Effective date for Diensten Tech Limited's inclusion in Long-Term ASM Stage-I
- **October 15, 2025**: Effective date for all stage movements (though none occurring in this cycle)
- **T+3 basis**: Timeline for shifting Stage-IV securities from EQ series to BE series (T being date of circular issuance)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited immediate impact as only one security is newly added to surveillance. Diensten Tech Limited will face stricter trading conditions including potential price bands and reduced liquidity.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update surveillance systems to monitor DTL under ASM Stage-I parameters. Enhanced disclosure requirements and risk management protocols apply.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading DTL must be aware of ASM restrictions which may include reduced trading flexibility, mandatory delivery-based settlement, and tighter price bands. The consolidated ASM list shows ongoing surveillance on multiple securities across different stages, indicating continued regulatory focus on market integrity.
