## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Members and investors using Franklin Templeton schemes on NSE MF Invest Platform need to be aware of the new investment thresholds and minimum installment requirements. Lower investment amounts (₹100-499) now require higher minimum installments (20 for daily SIP), which may affect investor flexibility.

**Investor Impact**: Investors with smaller SIP amounts will need to commit to longer investment periods. This change promotes disciplined long-term investing but may reduce accessibility for short-term investors.

**Market Impact**: Limited to Franklin Templeton schemes only. No broader market impact expected as this is an operational parameter adjustment for a single AMC on the NSE MF Invest platform.
