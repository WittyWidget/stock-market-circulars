## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine technical adjustment affecting only TAC INFOSEC LIMITED, an SME platform company. The 1:1 bonus issue doubles the number of shares, requiring the market lot to be adjusted from the standard 100 to 200 shares to maintain appropriate trading unit size. Members need to ensure their trading systems are updated to reflect the new market lot before trading begins on the effective date.
