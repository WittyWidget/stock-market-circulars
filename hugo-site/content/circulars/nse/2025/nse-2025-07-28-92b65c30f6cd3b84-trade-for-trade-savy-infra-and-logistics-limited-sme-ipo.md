## Summary

NSE has announced the transfer of Savy Infra and Logistics Limited (SAVY) securities from the trade for trade segment (Series: ST) to the rolling segment (Series: SM) effective August 11, 2025. This follows SEBI guidelines and is part of the standard post-IPO process for SME companies.

## Key Points

- SAVY securities will move from trade for trade segment to rolling segment
- Current series: ST (Trade for Trade)
- New series: SM (Rolling Segment)
- Change references previous circular NSE/CML/69307 dated July 25, 2025
- Follows SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012

## Regulatory Changes

Transition from trade for trade segment to rolling segment allows for more flexible trading arrangements, moving away from the mandatory delivery-based trading requirement typically imposed on newly listed SME stocks.

## Compliance Requirements

All NSE members must note the segment change and adjust their trading systems accordingly for SAVY securities effective from the specified date.

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 11, 2025
- **Circular Date**: July 28, 2025
- **Reference Circular**: July 25, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This change will improve liquidity and trading flexibility for SAVY shares by allowing intraday trading and settlements through the rolling segment mechanism, which is beneficial for market participants and the stock's trading volume.
