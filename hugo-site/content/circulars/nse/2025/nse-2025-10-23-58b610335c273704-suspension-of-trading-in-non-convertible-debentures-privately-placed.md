## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes are introduced. This circular implements existing Regulation 3.1.2 of the National Stock Exchange Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A, which governs the suspension of debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

Members must note the suspension of the following securities:

1. **L&T Finance Limited** - ISIN: INE027E07CC6
2. **Clix Capital Services Private Limited** - ISIN: INE157D07DU3
3. **Larsen & Toubro Limited** - ISIN: INE018A08BK6

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 23, 2025
- **Suspension Effective Date**: October 24, 2025 (for all three NCDs)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The suspension affects holders of privately placed Non-Convertible Debentures in three companies. Since these are redemptions, investors will receive their principal back according to the terms of the debentures.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders in these three instruments will no longer be able to trade these securities on the exchange from October 24, 2025. However, this is a standard process for maturing debt securities, and investors should receive redemption proceeds as per the original terms.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the suspension and ensure no trades are executed in these ISINs after the suspension date. This is a routine operational update for debt market participants.
