## Summary

The National Stock Exchange has announced the listing of additional equity shares for three companies - Mahindra Lifespace Developers Limited, Praxis Home Retail Limited, and Simplex Infrastructures Limited. These securities will be admitted to dealings on the NSE Capital Market segment effective September 3, 2025.

## Key Points

- Mahindra Lifespace Developers: 10,300 shares allotted under Abeyance at Rs. 257 per share
- Praxis Home Retail: 49,580,000 shares allotted under Rights Issue at Rs. 10 per share
- Simplex Infrastructures: 865,052 shares from warrant conversion at Rs. 289 per share
- All securities will trade with market lot size of 1 share
- Securities are pari passu with existing shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. Standard listing procedures under NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations Part A (Regulations 3.1.1 and 2.5.5) are being followed.

## Compliance Requirements

- Securities to be identified by designated codes (MAHLIFE, PRAXIS, SIMPLEXINF)
- Trading in specified lot sizes as per annexure
- Lock-in requirement only for Simplex Infrastructures shares until March 15, 2026
- Shares credited under temporary ISIN in accordance with SEBI circulars CIR/MRD/DP/21/2012 and CIR/MRD/DP/24/2012

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: September 3, 2025
- **Allotment Dates**:
  - Mahindra Lifespace: August 1, 2025
  - Praxis Home Retail: August 26, 2025
  - Simplex Infrastructures: July 21, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: March 15, 2026 (Simplex Infrastructures only)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected as these are further issues of already listed companies. Praxis Home Retail's rights issue of 49.58 million shares represents the largest addition. The warrant conversion for Simplex Infrastructures comes with lock-in restrictions until March 2026, limiting immediate liquidity impact.
