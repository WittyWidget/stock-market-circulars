## Summary

NSE has updated the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective August 5, 2025. No new securities have been added to Stage-I or Stage-II, and no securities are moving between stages. Four securities are being excluded from the ASM framework, while 21 securities remain under Stage-I surveillance.

## Key Points

- No new securities added to ST-ASM Stage-I or Stage-II
- No securities moving between surveillance stages
- 4 securities excluded from ASM framework entirely
- 21 securities continue under Stage-I surveillance measures
- All changes effective from August 5, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Exclusion of four securities from ASM framework removes enhanced surveillance requirements for these stocks, allowing normal trading conditions to resume.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the exclusion of specified securities from ASM framework
- Normal trading parameters apply to excluded securities from August 5, 2025
- Continued compliance with Stage-I surveillance measures for remaining 21 securities

## Important Dates

- **August 5, 2025**: Effective date for all ASM framework changes

## Securities Excluded from ASM Framework

1. **BAWEJA** - Baweja Studios Limited (INE0JFJ01011)
2. **HUBTOWN** - Hubtown Limited (INE703H01016) 
3. **IEX** - Indian Energy Exchange Limited (INE022Q01020)
4. **LLOYDSENGG** - LLOYDS ENGINEERING WORKS LIMITED (INE093R01011)

## Securities Remaining Under Stage-I Surveillance

21 securities continue under Stage-I ASM framework including BCG (Brightcom Group Limited), DATAMATICS (Datamatics Global Services Limited), ETL (Emkay Tools Limited), and others as listed in the consolidated ASM framework.

## Impact Assessment

Moderate positive impact for the four excluded securities as they return to normal trading conditions. Continued enhanced surveillance for remaining 21 securities maintains risk management protocols. Overall market impact is limited given the small number of affected securities.
