- Updated weekly SIP frequency options as per Notice-cum-Addendum no. 40 of 2025
- All other terms and conditions remain unchanged

## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 19, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is a procedural enhancement affecting only SIP scheduling options for Bandhan Mutual Fund schemes. The change provides greater flexibility to investors in timing their weekly investments but does not affect fund performance, fees, or investment strategy. Limited to operational improvements on the NSE MF Invest Platform.
