## Summary

NSE has applied Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I to two securities effective September 5, 2025. The measure increases margin requirements to 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher) with a maximum cap of 100% for both existing and new positions.

## Key Points

- Two securities included in ST-ASM Stage I: ANB Metal Cast Limited (AMCL) and Bharat Seats Limited (BHARATSE)
- Margin requirement increased to 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher
- Maximum margin capped at 100%
- Four securities excluded from ASM framework including Apollo Micro Systems and Aditya Infotech
- ASM framework works in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of ST-ASM Stage I for specified securities
- Enhanced margin requirements for affected stocks
- Exclusion of four securities from ASM framework with specific transitions to LTASM and ESM frameworks

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with increased margin requirements
- Applicable to all open positions as on September 4, 2025
- New positions from September 5, 2025 subject to enhanced margins
- Members should refer to NSE FAQs for detailed ASM information

## Important Dates

- **September 4, 2025**: Cut-off date for existing positions
- **September 5, 2025**: Effective date for ST-ASM Stage I implementation and enhanced margin requirements

## Impact Assessment

- Limited impact affecting only two securities in ST-ASM Stage I
- Increased trading costs for affected stocks due to higher margin requirements
- Four securities benefit from ASM framework exclusion
- Market surveillance action not construed as adverse action against companies
