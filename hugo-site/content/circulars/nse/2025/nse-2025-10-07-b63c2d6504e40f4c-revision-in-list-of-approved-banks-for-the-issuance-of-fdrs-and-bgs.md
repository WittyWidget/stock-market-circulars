## Summary

NSE Clearing Limited has updated the list of approved banks for issuing Fixed Deposit Receipts (FDRs) and Bank Guarantees (BGs) under the Securities Lending & Borrowing Scheme. The South Indian Bank Ltd. has been added to the existing approved banks list, with authorization for E-FDR issuance only.

## Key Points

- The South Indian Bank Ltd. added to approved banks list
- Bank approved for E-FDR issuance: Yes
- Bank approved for E-BG issuance: No
- Applicable for security deposit and margin deposit requirements under SLBS
- Circular reference: 111/2025 (Download Ref No: NCL/CMPT/70669)
- Supersedes circular 102/2025 dated September 22, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Expansion of approved banks list to provide participants with additional options for depositing collateral through fixed deposit receipts. The South Indian Bank Ltd. joins the existing panel of authorized banks for SLBS collateral purposes.

## Compliance Requirements

- All SLBS participants and custodians are advised to take note of the revised approved banks list
- Participants may use The South Indian Bank Ltd. for E-FDR issuance towards security and margin deposits
- E-BG facility is not available with this bank

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of The South Indian Bank Ltd. enhances flexibility for participants in managing their margin and security deposit requirements, though it does not change any existing obligations or processes.
