---

## Summary

NSE has revised the service level agreement for processing colocation IP requests, significantly reducing processing time from 30 days to T+5 working days. The changes apply to Message Rate Change (upgrade/downgrade) and IP surrender requests, with new fee structures for multiple requests within the same calendar month.

## Key Points

- 30 days notice period for Message Rate Change (downgrade) and IP surrender requests discontinued
- New processing timeline: T+5 working days for requests submitted by 3:00 PM
- First Message Rate Change request per IP per calendar month remains free
- Subsequent requests in same month charged Rs 2,000 plus applicable taxes
- One free message category change per month per IP allowed
- All existing pending downgrade and surrender requests will be rejected

## Regulatory Changes

- Partial modification to Section II.D of Exchange circular NSE/MSD/67756 dated April 29, 2025
- Revised SLA timelines replacing the existing 30-day notice period
- Introduction of monthly limits and fee structures for multiple requests

## Compliance Requirements

- Colocation participants must resubmit fresh requests for pending Message Rate Change (downgrade) and IP surrender applications
- Requests must be submitted before 3:00 PM on working days for T+5 processing
- Application Processing Fees plus applicable taxes required for Message Rate Change requests
- Members limited to one free message category change per IP per month

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: September 1, 2025
- **Request Submission Deadline**: 3:00 PM on working days for T+5 processing
- **Monthly Reset**: Processing fee benefits reset each calendar month

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact:**
- Significantly faster processing (T+5 vs 30 days) improves operational efficiency

- Best effort processing commitment provides better service predictability

**Operational Impact:**
- Colocation participants need to resubmit existing pending requests
- Monthly planning required for multiple IP changes to optimize costs
- Enhanced flexibility for message rate adjustments with faster turnaround

**Cost Impact:**
- Potential cost savings for single monthly requests per IP
- Additional charges (Rs 2,000 + taxes) for multiple requests in same month
