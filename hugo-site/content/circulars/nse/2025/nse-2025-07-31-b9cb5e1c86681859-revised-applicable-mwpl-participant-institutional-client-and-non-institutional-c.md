- Limits are effective for August 2025 trading month

- **Effective Period**: August 2025
- **Reference Circular**: NCL/CMPT/67763 dated April 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Moderate impact on Securities Lending and Borrowing operations. The revised limits will affect trading capacity for participants and their clients in the SLB segment. Higher limits for securities like ALOKINDS (124+ million shares MWPL) and ADANIPOWER (96+ million shares MWPL) indicate strong borrowing demand, while lower limits for stocks like 3MINDIA (281K shares) reflect limited availability for lending.
