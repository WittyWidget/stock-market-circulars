---

## Summary

NSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework, adding two securities to ESM Stage I effective August 8, 2025. The affected securities will face minimum 100% margin requirements and will be shifted from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment starting August 11, 2025.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to ESM Stage I: INNOVANA (Innovana Thinklabs Limited) and ORTINGLOBE (ORTIN GLOBAL LIMITED)
- 100% minimum margin requirement applies to all open positions as of August 8, 2025, and new positions from August 11, 2025
- Securities will shift from Rolling Settlement segment (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST)
- No securities are being excluded from the ESM framework
- No securities are moving between ESM stages
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Enhanced margin requirements of minimum 100% for ESM Stage I securities
- Segment classification change from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade for affected securities
- Securities moving to Stage II will be under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure compliance with 100% margin requirements for ESM Stage I securities
- Adherence to Trade-for-Trade settlement mechanism for affected securities
- Compliance with all other prevailing surveillance measures imposed by exchanges

## Important Dates

- **August 8, 2025**: ESM Stage I classification effective date
- **August 11, 2025**: Securities shift from EQ/SM to BE/ST segment
- **August 11, 2025**: 100% margin requirement applies to new positions

## Impact Assessment

- **Trading Impact**: Limited to two specific securities with restricted trading through Trade-for-Trade mechanism
- **Margin Impact**: Significant increase in margin requirements to 100% minimum for affected securities
- **Liquidity Impact**: Potential reduction in liquidity due to Trade-for-Trade restrictions
- **Market Participant Impact**: Increased capital requirements for trading these securities
- **Clarification**: ESM shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the companies
