## Summary

NSE has issued surveillance circular imposing Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) on select securities effective October 16-17, 2025. Three securities (MANAV, TECHERA, WEWIN) are being added to ESM Stage I, while DRSCARGO moves from Stage I to Stage II. Securities under ESM will attract minimum 100% margin on all positions and will be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM series) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST series). Stage II securities will additionally be placed under Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band.

## Key Points

- Three new securities included in ESM Stage I: Manav Infra Projects Limited, TechEra Engineering (India) Limited, and WE WIN LIMITED
- DRS Cargo Movers Limited moves from ESM Stage I to Stage II
- Minimum 100% margin applicable on all open positions as on October 16, 2025 and new positions from October 17, 2025
- Securities shifting from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST) effective October 17, 2025
- Stage II securities will be under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction from October 16, 2025
- No securities excluded from ESM framework in this update
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

The circular implements stringent trading restrictions under the Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework. Securities identified under ESM criteria will be subject to:

1. **Margin Requirements**: Minimum 100% margin on all positions (both existing and new)
2. **Segment Change**: Mandatory shift from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade segment
3. **Stage-based Restrictions**: Stage II securities face additional constraints including Periodic Call Auction mechanism with restricted 2% price band

This circular references previous ESM framework circulars: NSE/SURV/56948 (June 02, 2023), NSE/SURV/57609 (July 18, 2023), NSE/SURV/63361 (August 09, 2024), NSE/SURV/64066 (September 20, 2024), NSE/SURV/64400 (October 04, 2024), and NSE/SURV/69315 (July 25, 2025).

## Compliance Requirements

**For NSE Trading Members:**
- Ensure collection of minimum 100% margin from clients on affected securities

- Apply margin requirements to all new positions created from October 17, 2025
- Update trading systems to reflect segment changes (EQ/SM to BE/ST series)
- Implement price band restrictions for Stage II securities
- Comply with Trade-for-Trade settlement requirements

**For Investors/Traders:**
- Maintain adequate margins (100% minimum) for positions in ESM securities
- Be aware of reduced liquidity due to Trade-for-Trade mechanism (no intraday squaring off)
- Account for 2% price band restrictions for Stage II securities in Periodic Call Auction

## Important Dates

- **October 15, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **October 16, 2025**: 
  - ESM Stage changes become effective

- **October 17, 2025**: 
  - New positions attract 100% margin requirement
  - Securities shift from EQ/SM series to BE/ST series (Trade-for-Trade segment)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Significantly reduced liquidity in affected securities due to Trade-for-Trade mechanism
- Price discovery constraints from 2% price band for Stage II securities
- Limited intraday trading opportunities as positions cannot be squared off intraday
- Potential increase in volatility upon implementation due to forced position adjustments

**Operational Impact:**
- Higher capital requirements for traders holding positions in ESM securities (100% margin vs typical 20-40%)
- Increased settlement obligations as all trades require delivery
- Enhanced monitoring requirements for brokers and risk management systems
- Potential portfolio rebalancing by institutional investors avoiding high-margin securities
