---

## Summary

NSE has announced that MT Educare Limited (MTEDUCARE) will be moved to Stage I of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective July 28, 2025. This action implements enhanced surveillance measures including 100% margin requirements and a 5% price band restriction to monitor unusual price movements and trading patterns.

## Key Points

- MT Educare Limited (Symbol: MTEDUCARE, ISIN: INE472M01018) subject to Stage I GSM
- Enhanced surveillance measures effective from July 28, 2025
- 100% applicable margin rate imposed
- Price band restricted to 5% or lower as applicable
- Members advised to exercise adequate precaution while trading

## Regulatory Changes

MT Educare Limited has been placed under the first stage of NSE's Graded Surveillance Measure framework, which is a progressive surveillance system with four stages of increasing restrictions. Stage I represents the initial level of enhanced monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must apply 100% margin rate for MT Educare Limited
- Price band of 5% or lower must be enforced
- Members required to take adequate precautions while facilitating trades in this security
- Continued monitoring of trading patterns and compliance with GSM framework requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 28, 2025 - GSM Stage I measures become applicable for MT Educare Limited

## Impact Assessment

The move to Stage I GSM will increase the cost of trading MT Educare Limited due to the 100% margin requirement, potentially reducing speculative activity and trading volumes. The 5% price band will limit daily price volatility. This is a standard surveillance measure that may indicate concerns about the security's trading patterns or fundamentals, though it represents the mildest level of GSM restrictions.
