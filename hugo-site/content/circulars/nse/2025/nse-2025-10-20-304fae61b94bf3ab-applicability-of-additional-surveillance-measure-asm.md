## Summary

NSE has issued Circular No. 813/2025 implementing Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) on one security. Shree Vasu Logistics Limited (SVLL) has been shortlisted under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I effective October 21, 2025. The exchange will impose 100% margin requirements on all positions in this security starting October 24, 2025. This surveillance action is part of NSE's ongoing market monitoring framework and should not be construed as adverse action against the company.

## Key Points

- One security (SVLL - Shree Vasu Logistics Limited, ISIN: INE00CE01017) added to Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- 100% margin rate applicable on all open positions as on October 23, 2025 and new positions from October 24, 2025 onwards
- No securities listed under Stage-IV requiring shift to Trade-for-Trade segment
- No securities moving between ASM stages in this circular
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with all other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance purposes

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure on selected securities based on surveillance criteria established in previous circulars (NSE/SURV/39265, NSE/SURV/45111, NSE/SURV/46557, NSE/SURV/48506, NSE/SURV/52090, NSE/SURV/63362, and NSE/SURV/64066). The regulatory framework requires enhanced margin requirements for securities exhibiting characteristics warranting heightened surveillance.

## Compliance Requirements

- All NSE members must apply 100% margin rate on SVLL (Shree Vasu Logistics Limited) effective October 24, 2025
- Margin applies to all open positions as on October 23, 2025
- Margin applies to all new positions created from October 24, 2025 onwards
- Members must comply with ASM framework alongside all other existing surveillance measures
- Market participants should refer to NSE FAQs on Additional Surveillance Measure at https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/additional-surveillance-measure

## Important Dates

- **October 20, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **October 21, 2025**: Effective date for securities shortlisted under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- **October 23, 2025**: Last day before margin requirements apply to existing positions
- **October 24, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes applicable on all positions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited impact as only one security is affected in this circular. Traders and investors holding positions in SVLL will face significantly higher margin requirements (100%), which may reduce liquidity and trading activity in the stock.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and members must ensure systems are updated to apply the enhanced margin requirements. Clients with existing positions in SVLL will need to maintain higher margins or reduce positions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in Shree Vasu Logistics Limited will experience increased capital requirements for maintaining positions, potentially affecting short-term trading strategies and position sizes. The ASM designation may also signal to market participants that the security warrants enhanced monitoring, though NSE clarifies this should not be viewed as adverse action against the company.
