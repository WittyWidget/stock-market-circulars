## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine corporate action involving the redemption of privately placed debt instruments. The suspension affects only holders and traders of these specific NCDs and does not impact the equity shares of the companies or broader market operations.

**Investor Impact**: Holders of these NCDs will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of the debentures. No trading will be possible after the suspension date, which is standard practice for redeemed instruments.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the suspension, but this is a standard operational procedure for debt securities reaching maturity or redemption.
