## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. These are routine further issue listings with relatively small volumes except for Balu Forge (1.9 million shares) and Ind-Swift Laboratories (6.58 million shares). The lock-in periods on the larger warrant conversions will prevent immediate market supply impact.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Standard trading procedures apply with market lot of 1 for all securities. No special trading arrangements required.

**Dilution Impact**: Company-specific; warrant conversions at Balu Forge and Ind-Swift Labs represent capital raising and shareholder dilution, while ESOP allotments are part of regular employee compensation programs.
