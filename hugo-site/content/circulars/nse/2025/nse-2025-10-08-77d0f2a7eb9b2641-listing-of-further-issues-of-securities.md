## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The listing increases the float for these companies, particularly significant for Adani Green Energy (5.46 million shares) and Embassy Developments (5.38 million shares). However, lock-in periods on preferential shares limit immediate tradable supply.

**Liquidity Impact:** ESOP allotments for ICICI Bank, ICICI Prudential, and Arvind Fashions add to tradable float immediately as they have no lock-in restrictions.

**Dilution Impact:** Varies by company; warrant conversions increase paid-up capital and may have minor dilutive effect on existing shareholders.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - routine administrative listing process for members and clearing systems.
