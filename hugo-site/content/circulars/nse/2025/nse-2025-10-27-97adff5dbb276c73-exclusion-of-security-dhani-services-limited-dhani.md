- **October 28, 2025**: Effective date for exclusion from SLB segment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to participants engaged in Securities Lending & Borrowing activities involving DHANI. Borrowers and lenders of DHANI securities will need to close or manage existing positions as the security will no longer be available for new SLB transactions.

**Operational Impact**: Participants and custodians must update their systems and procedures to prevent new SLB transactions in DHANI from October 28, 2025. This follows the broader trading suspension already in effect for the security in the cash market.
