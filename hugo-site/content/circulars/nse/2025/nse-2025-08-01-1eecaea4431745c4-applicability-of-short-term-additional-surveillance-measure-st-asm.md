## Summary

NSE has updated the Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective August 4, 2025. Three securities have been added to Stage-I of ST-ASM, while six securities are being excluded from the ASM framework entirely. The consolidated list now contains 25 securities under ASM surveillance.

## Key Points

- 3 securities added to Short-Term ASM Framework Stage-I: PLADAINFO, WHITEFORCE, and ZUARI
- No securities in Stage-II or moving between stages
- 6 securities excluded from ASM framework: GABRIEL, MANAKALUCO, ORTINGLOBE, PATILAUTOM, ROSSTECH, VERITAAS
- ORTINGLOBE moved from ST-ASM to LT-ASM framework
- Total 25 securities currently under ASM surveillance (all in Stage-I)

## Regulatory Changes

The Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework has been updated to include new securities showing unusual price movements or trading patterns. Securities under ST-ASM are subject to enhanced monitoring and may have additional trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ASM framework requirements for listed securities
- Enhanced surveillance measures apply to all securities listed in the framework
- Specific trading conditions and restrictions as per ASM guidelines must be followed

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 4, 2025 - New ASM framework list becomes applicable

## Impact Assessment

The addition of three securities to ST-ASM Stage-I indicates NSE's continued focus on market integrity and investor protection. Securities under ASM framework typically experience enhanced monitoring which may affect trading volumes and liquidity. The exclusion of six securities suggests improved compliance or trading patterns for those companies. Market participants should adjust their trading strategies accordingly for affected securities.
