## Key Points

- 906 partly paid equity shares to be listed under symbol UPLPP1
- Face value: Rs. 2/- each with Re. 1/- paid-up
- Market lot size: 1 share
- Shares are pari passu with existing equity shares
- No lock-in restrictions applicable
- Temporary ISIN IN8628A01035 used for dematerialized shares initially

## Regulatory Changes

None. This is a routine listing notification under existing NSE Capital Market Trading Regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use designated security code UPLPP1 for trading
- Trading must be conducted in specified lot sizes
- Shares currently under temporary ISIN will be transferred to permanent ISIN as per SEBI guidelines

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 31, 2025
- **Circular Date**: July 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected given the small number of shares (906) being listed. This appears to be a routine further issue related to existing corporate actions or employee stock options. The partly paid nature suggests these may be related to a rights issue or similar corporate action.
