An Additional Margin of 2.50% will be levied on all variants of Silver Futures contracts, and 1.00% on all variants of Gold Futures contracts for specified expiries, effective from October 23, 2025 (Begin of Day). This circular is issued in continuation of previous risk management measures.

## Key Points

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 23, 2025 (Begin of Day)

- **Affected Expiries**: October 31, 2025; November 4, 28, 2025; December 5, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The additional margin requirements will significantly impact traders and members holding positions in Gold and Silver futures contracts. Members will need to arrange for additional capital to meet the enhanced margin obligations. The 2.50% increase on Silver contracts and 1.00% on Gold contracts represent substantial increases in capital requirements, particularly for large position holders. This may lead to reduced leverage, position adjustments, or increased funding costs for market participants in the commodity derivatives segment. The measure indicates heightened volatility or risk concerns in precious metals markets.
