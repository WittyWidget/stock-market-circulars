## Summary

The National Stock Exchange of India has issued a circular notifying the suspension of trading in Non-Convertible Debentures (Privately Placed) of two companies effective October 27, 2025. The suspension is being implemented due to the redemption of these debt instruments. This action is taken in pursuance of Regulation 3.1.2 of the National Stock Exchange Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A.

## Key Points

- Two NCDs will be suspended from trading on NSE's debt market platform
- Suspension effective date: October 27, 2025
- Both suspensions are due to redemption of the debt instruments
- The Great Eastern Shipping Company Limited NCD (ISIN: INE017A08250) affected
- Latur Renewable Private Limited NCD (ISIN: INE03IL08034) affected
- Circular issued by Listing Department
- Circular reference number: 2079/2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing provisions under Regulation 3.1.2 of the National Stock Exchange Debt Market (Trading) Regulations Part A, which governs the suspension of debt securities from trading.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must note the suspension of these two NCDs from their trading systems
- Trading in the specified ISINs must cease from October 27, 2025
- Members should update their systems to reflect the suspended status of these instruments
- No new trades in these NCDs should be accepted from the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: October 24, 2025
- **Suspension Effective Date**: October 27, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The suspension affects only two privately placed NCDs and is a routine administrative action following the scheduled redemption of these instruments. Privately placed debentures typically have limited secondary market trading activity.

**Investor Impact**: Minimal. Investors holding these NCDs will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of the instruments. No trading is expected post-redemption announcement.

**Operational Impact**: Routine operational update for exchange members to remove these ISINs from their trading platforms.
