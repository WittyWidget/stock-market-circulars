title: Revised List of Approved Securities and Banks for Non-Cash Component of Liquid
  Assets
---

## Summary

NSE has issued a revised list of 40 equity shares that are approved as the non-cash component of liquid assets for the Futures & Options (FO) segment. These securities are subject to Value at Risk (VAR) based haircuts and quantity restrictions to ensure adequate risk management in margin collateral.

## Key Points

- 40 equity shares approved for use as non-cash collateral in FO segment
- VAR-based haircut applicable on all listed securities
- Maximum 25% of total margins can be deposited in each individual security
- Overall permitted quantities specified across all segments
- Member-wise permitted quantities for FO segment marked as N.A (not applicable/to be determined separately)
- List includes major blue-chip stocks across sectors including banking, IT, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, energy, and FMCG

## Regulatory Changes

This circular provides an updated list of approved securities eligible as collateral. The framework maintains:

- VAR-based haircut methodology for all approved securities
- Concentration limits of 25% per security to prevent over-concentration risk
- Specified overall permitted quantities for each security to manage systemic exposure

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure individual security deposits do not exceed 25% of total margin requirements
- Members must comply with overall permitted quantity limits specified for each security
- Only the 40 listed securities are eligible as non-cash liquid assets for FO segment margins
- Securities must be accepted subject to applicable VAR haircuts

## Important Dates

No specific effective date or deadline mentioned in the circular content provided. This appears to be an ongoing list revision.
