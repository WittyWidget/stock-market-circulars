## Summary

NSE has announced non-business days for certain mutual fund schemes on the NSE MF Invest Platform for September 2025. Subscriptions, redemptions, switches, SIPs, STPs, and SWPs will not be allowed for the specified schemes on the designated non-business day dates.

## Key Points

- Non-business days apply to specific mutual fund schemes listed in Annexure-I
- All types of transactions (subscriptions, redemptions, switches, SIPs, STPs, SWPs) are restricted on NBD dates
- Applies to schemes from Axis, Bandhan, and DSP mutual funds
- Effective dates are September 1, 2025, and September 5, 2025
- Communication based on inputs received from respective mutual funds

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes - this is an operational notification for platform transaction restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must take note of the non-business day schedules
- Ensure no transactions are processed for listed schemes on specified dates
- Refer to Annexure-I for complete list of affected schemes and their ISINs

## Important Dates

- **September 1, 2025**: Non-business day for Axis Global Equity Alpha Fund schemes and Axis Global Innovation Fund schemes
- **September 5, 2025**: Non-business day for Bandhan US Equity Fund of Fund schemes and DSP mutual fund schemes

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact limited to specific fund-of-fund schemes from three AMCs. Investors in these schemes will need to plan transactions around the non-business days. The restriction affects international equity fund-of-funds primarily, which may impact investors seeking overseas exposure through these vehicles.
