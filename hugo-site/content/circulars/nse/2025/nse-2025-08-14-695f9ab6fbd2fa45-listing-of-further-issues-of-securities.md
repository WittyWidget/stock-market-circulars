## Compliance Requirements

- Securities will be identified only by designated codes

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected as these are routine ESOP-based equity share listings. The additional shares represent normal employee benefit exercises and will trade alongside existing equity shares without special conditions. Market liquidity may see marginal increase for affected stocks, but no significant price impact anticipated given the nature and scale of additional shares.
