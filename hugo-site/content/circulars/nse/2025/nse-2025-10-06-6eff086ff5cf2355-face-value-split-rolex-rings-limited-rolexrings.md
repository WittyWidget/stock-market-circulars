## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The face value split will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while proportionally reducing the price per share. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors by lowering the absolute price per share.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders will see their shareholding quantity multiply by 10, with the market capitalization remaining unchanged. No dilution of ownership or value occurs.

**Trading Impact:** Post-split trading will commence at approximately 1/10th of the pre-split price, potentially increasing trading volumes and participation from smaller investors.
