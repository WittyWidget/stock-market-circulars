## Summary

NSE has implemented Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework with stringent trading restrictions. The measure includes 100% margin requirements on all positions and potential shift to trade-for-trade settlement for qualifying securities effective August 8, 2025.

## Key Points

- 100% margin requirement applicable on all open positions as of August 7, 2025 and new positions from August 8, 2025
- Securities meeting Stage IV criteria will be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE)
- Bohra Industries Limited (BOHRAIND) included in Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework
- Enhanced margin requirements from standard rates to 100%
- Segment classification changes for qualifying securities from EQ to BE series
- Strengthened surveillance mechanisms for identified securities

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain 100% margin for ASM securities
- Members must comply with trade-for-trade settlement procedures for Stage IV securities
- Adherence to all surveillance measures in conjunction with existing frameworks
- Reference to FAQs available at NSE website for detailed compliance guidance

## Important Dates

- **August 5, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **August 7, 2025**: Last day for existing positions under current margin structure
- **August 8, 2025**: Effective date for 100% margin requirement and trade-for-trade implementation
- **T+3 basis**: Timeline for segment shifts (T being circular issuance date)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - 100% margin requirements significantly increase capital requirements for trading ASM securities, potentially reducing liquidity and trading volumes. Trade-for-trade settlement eliminates intraday trading opportunities.

**Operational Impact**: High - Brokers and traders must adjust risk management systems, margin calculations, and settlement processes. Increased compliance monitoring required.

**Investor Impact**: High - Retail and institutional investors face higher capital deployment requirements, affecting position sizing and trading strategies for affected securities.
