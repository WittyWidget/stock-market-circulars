title: Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Applied to Five Securities
---

## Summary

NSE has implemented Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I on five securities effective July 29, 2025. The measure requires a minimum 50% margin or existing margin (whichever is higher) capped at 100% for all positions. Two securities are being excluded from the ASM framework. This is a market surveillance action and not an adverse action against the companies.

## Key Points

- Five securities shortlisted under ST-ASM Stage I: Baweja Studios Limited, Datamatics Global Services Limited, Indian Energy Exchange Limited, Rite Zone Chemcon India Limited, and VR Infraspace Limited
- Enhanced margin requirement of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at 100%
- No securities currently in Stage II or moving between stages
- Two securities excluded from ASM framework: Crayons Advertising Limited and Magellanic Cloud
- Surveillance measure is purely for market monitoring, not punitive action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework with staged approach for enhanced market surveillance and risk management.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain applicable margin rates of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher) for affected securities
- Margin requirements apply to all open positions as on July 28, 2025 and new positions from July 29, 2025
- Compliance with all other prevailing surveillance measures remains mandatory
- Price bands will be reinstated when securities exit the framework, subject to no other surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **July 28, 2025**: Cut-off date for existing positions
- **July 29, 2025**: Effective date for enhanced margin requirements on new and existing positions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects liquidity and trading costs for five specific securities, requiring higher capital commitment from traders and investors.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - traders need to adjust position sizing and margin planning for affected securities, potentially reducing speculative activity in these stocks.

**Compliance Impact**: Low to Medium - straightforward margin requirement changes that fit within existing surveillance framework without requiring new operational procedures.
