## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Members currently using Order Snapshot Recovery via TCP/IP for MTBT broadcast must update their connection configurations to reflect the new port number. Failure to update may result in connection failures or data feed disruptions.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a technical infrastructure update that does not affect trading mechanics or market structure.

**Member Responsibility**: Members are reminded that they bear sole responsibility for infrastructure redundancy, bandwidth management, and any issues arising from their market data broadcast configurations. NSE will not be liable for disconnections, bandwidth utilization issues, or latency problems stemming from members' configuration decisions.

**Technical Considerations**: The broadcast size is an estimated approximation that varies with market activity, requiring members to continuously monitor and size their infrastructure appropriately.
