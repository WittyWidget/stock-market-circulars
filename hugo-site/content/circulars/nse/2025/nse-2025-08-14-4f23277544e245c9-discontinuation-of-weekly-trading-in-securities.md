title: Discontinuation of weekly trading in Varanium Cloud Limited securities
---

## Summary

NSE announces the discontinuation of weekly trading restrictions for Varanium Cloud Limited (Symbol: CLOUD) effective September 2, 2025. The company was previously restricted to trading only on the first trading day of each week on a 'Trade for Trade' basis due to non-compliance with shareholding pattern submission requirements.

## Key Points

- Weekly trading restrictions on Varanium Cloud Limited to be lifted
- Company was non-compliant with Regulation 31 (Shareholding Pattern submission) for two consecutive half years (March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024)
- Mandated six-month period of restricted trading will complete on September 3, 2025
- Trading restrictions will end at closing hours on September 1, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Removal of weekly trading restrictions that limited Varanium Cloud Limited to trading only on the first trading day of each week on 'Trade for Trade' basis (Series "SZ").

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. The circular addresses the completion of penalty period for previous non-compliance with SEBI Listing Regulations regarding shareholding pattern submissions.

## Important Dates

- **September 1, 2025**: Last day of weekly trading restrictions (closing hours)
- **September 2, 2025**: Effective date for discontinuation of weekly trading restrictions
- **September 3, 2025**: Completion of mandated six-month restricted trading period

## Impact Assessment

Positive impact for Varanium Cloud Limited shareholders and traders as the stock will return to normal daily trading from September 2, 2025. This will improve liquidity and trading flexibility for the security, removing the constraint of weekly-only trading that was imposed as a regulatory penalty.
