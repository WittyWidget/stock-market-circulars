title: Revised Applicable MWPL, Participant, Institutional Client and Non Institutional
  Client Limits for Securities and ETFs - SLBS
---

## Summary

NSE has revised the Market Wide Position Limits (MWPL), participant limits, institutional client limits, and non-institutional client limits for 67 securities and ETFs under the Securities Lending and Borrowing Scheme (SLBS). The circular provides a comprehensive table with updated position limits across four categories for each security.

## Key Points

- Revised position limits for 67 securities and ETFs under SLBS
- Four-tier limit structure: Market Wide Position Limit, Participant Limit, Institutional Client Limit, and Non-Institutional Client Limit
- Limits vary significantly across securities based on market capitalization and liquidity
- Non-institutional client limits are typically 10% of participant/institutional limits
- Includes major stocks like Adani group companies, ACC, Apollo, and various ETFs

## Regulatory Changes

Updated position limits framework for Securities Lending and Borrowing Scheme with differentiated limits for various participant categories to ensure orderly market functioning and risk management.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must adhere to the revised position limits immediately
- Separate compliance for institutional and non-institutional clients
- Participants must monitor positions against the new limits
- Risk management systems should be updated to reflect new limits

## Important Dates

Effective immediately upon circular issuance on August 29, 2025.

## Impact Assessment

The revised limits will affect trading strategies and position sizing for participants in the securities lending and borrowing market. Tighter limits on some securities may reduce available lending/borrowing capacity while expanded limits on others may increase market activity. The differentiated structure ensures appropriate risk management across participant categories.
