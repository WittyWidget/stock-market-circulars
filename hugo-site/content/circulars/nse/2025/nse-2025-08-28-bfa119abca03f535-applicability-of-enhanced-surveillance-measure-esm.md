title: Applicability of Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - September 2025 Updates
---

## Summary

NSE has announced updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective August 29 and September 1, 2025. Three new securities will be added to ESM Stage-I with 100% margin requirements, while two securities will move from Stage-I to Stage-II under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band restrictions.

## Key Points

- Three securities added to ESM Stage-I: Andhra Cements Limited (ACL), Parth Electricals & Engineering Limited (PARTH), and Reliable Data Services Limited (RELIABLE)
- Two securities moving from Stage-I to Stage-II: Krishival Foods Limited (KRISHIVAL) and Shree Ram Proteins Limited (SRPL)
- All ESM securities will shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST)
- Stage-II securities will operate under Periodic Call Auction with 2% price band
- No securities are being excluded from the ESM framework

## Regulatory Changes

- Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework continues with staged approach
- Securities in ESM attract minimum 100% margin on all positions
- Stage-II securities operate under Trade-for-Trade with price band restrictions
- Framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure 100% margin compliance for ESM securities
- Trading members must adjust systems for segment changes from EQ/SM to BE/ST
- Stage-II securities require adherence to 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- Members should monitor consolidated ESM list for ongoing compliance

## Important Dates

- August 29, 2025: Stage transitions effective, Stage-II securities under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band
- September 1, 2025: New ESM Stage-I securities attract 100% margin, segment shift to BE/ST effective
- September 1, 2025: All open positions as of August 29 and new positions subject to 100% margin

## Impact Assessment

High impact on trading liquidity and capital requirements. The 100% margin requirement significantly increases capital costs for traders in affected securities. Segment shift to Trade-for-Trade reduces liquidity by eliminating intraday squaring off. Stage-II restrictions with 2% price band and Periodic Call Auction further limit trading flexibility. Market participants trading these securities will face increased operational complexity and capital allocation challenges.
