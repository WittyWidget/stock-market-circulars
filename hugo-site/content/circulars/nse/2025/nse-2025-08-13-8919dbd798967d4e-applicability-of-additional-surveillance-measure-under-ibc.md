## Summary

NSE has updated the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Lakshmi Precision Screws Limited (LAKPRE) has been added to ASM IBC Stage I effective August 14, 2025. No securities are being excluded from the surveillance measures.

## Key Points

- Lakshmi Precision Screws Limited (LAKPRE, ISIN: INE651C01018) added to ASM IBC Stage I
- No securities moved between stages or were excluded from surveillance
- ASM IBC framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against the company

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing ASM IBC framework as established in previous circulars from June 2018, May 2022, and February 2023.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with ASM IBC trading restrictions for LAKPRE
- All existing surveillance measures remain applicable alongside ASM IBC
- Members should monitor consolidated ASM IBC list for trading compliance

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 14, 2025 - ASM IBC Stage I applicable to Lakshmi Precision Screws Limited

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as only one security is affected. LAKPRE will face enhanced surveillance measures including potential trading restrictions, increased margin requirements, and closer monitoring. The consolidated ASM IBC list now includes Arshiya Limited, Compuage Infocom Limited, Future Lifestyle Fashions Limited, and Future Supply Chain Solutions Limited in addition to the newly added Lakshmi Precision Screws Limited.
