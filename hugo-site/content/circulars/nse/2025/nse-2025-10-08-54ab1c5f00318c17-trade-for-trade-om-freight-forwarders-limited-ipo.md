## Summary

NSE has announced that Om Freight Forwarders Limited (OMFREIGHT) will be transferred from the trade for trade segment (series: BE) to the rolling segment (series: EQ) effective October 24, 2025. This follows the initial listing circular dated October 07, 2025 and is in accordance with SEBI guidelines (CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012).

## Key Points

- Security: Om Freight Forwarders Limited (Symbol: OMFREIGHT)
- Current segment: Trade for Trade (Series: BE)
- New segment: Rolling Settlement (Series: EQ)
- Effective date: October 24, 2025
- Reason: Standard post-IPO segment migration as per SEBI guidelines

## Regulatory Changes

Transition from trade-for-trade settlement (requiring full upfront delivery) to rolling settlement (T+1 settlement cycle with margin trading permitted). This is a standard procedure for IPO securities following SEBI circular CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the segment change from BE to EQ series
- All trading systems should be updated to reflect the new series designation
- Margin requirements will apply as per standard rolling settlement norms from October 24, 2025

## Important Dates

- **October 07, 2025**: Initial listing circular (NSE/CML/70659)
- **October 08, 2025**: Circular date announcing segment transfer
- **October 24, 2025**: Effective date for transfer to rolling segment (EQ series)

## Impact Assessment

Positive impact for investors and market liquidity. The transfer from trade-for-trade to rolling segment allows for normal margin trading, intraday trading, and standard T+1 settlement. This increases trading flexibility and typically improves liquidity for the security. The 16-day period from listing provides adequate time for price discovery under restricted trading conditions before full market access.
