## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of Moneyboxx Finance Limited adds another Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) to the NSE platform, providing investors with additional investment opportunities in the financial services sector. With approximately 91.7% of shares (29,981,111 + 2,153,489) freely tradable from the listing date, there is substantial float available for trading.

**Liquidity Considerations**: The market lot size of 1 share allows for granular trading and potentially better price discovery. The relatively small lock-in portion (570,000 shares or 1.74% of total) that expires on October 30, 2025, should have minimal impact on near-term liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors will have access to this NBFC from October 15, 2025. The compulsory demat requirement ensures settlement efficiency and reduces risks associated with physical share certificates.
