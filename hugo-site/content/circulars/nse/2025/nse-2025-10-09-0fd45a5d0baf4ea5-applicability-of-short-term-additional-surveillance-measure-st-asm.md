## Regulatory Framework

The Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) is a framework designed to enhance market surveillance and protect investor interests. Securities under this framework are subject to:

- Enhanced monitoring and surveillance
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Potential trading restrictions
- Two-stage classification system (Stage I and Stage II)

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ST-ASM framework requirements for affected securities
- Investors trading in these securities should be aware of the enhanced surveillance measures
- Market participants must adhere to any additional margin or trading restrictions applicable to ST-ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of 7 securities in ST-ASM Stage I indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny due to specific market behavior patterns. Investors in these securities may face:

- Increased margin requirements
- Enhanced scrutiny of trading activities
- Potential liquidity constraints
- Greater price volatility monitoring

The exclusion of 3 securities from the ASM framework suggests improved compliance or market behavior. However, Destiny Logistics & Infra Limited's movement to LT-ASM indicates continued surveillance under a different framework category.
