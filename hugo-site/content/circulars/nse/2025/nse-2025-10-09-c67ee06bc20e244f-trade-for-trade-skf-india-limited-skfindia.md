The stock will also be included in the call auction during the pre-open session as per SEBI guidelines.

## Key Points

- Trading Series: BE (Trade for Trade)
- Effective Date: October 15, 2025 (Wednesday)
- Reason: Pursuant to Scheme of Arrangement

- Governed by SEBI Circular No. CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012 dated January 20, 2012

## Regulatory Changes

- All trades must result in compulsory delivery
- Settlement occurs on a trade-for-trade basis

- Participation in pre-open call auction session is applicable

## Important Dates

- **Circular Issue Date**: October 09, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 15, 2025 (Wednesday)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Movement to Trade for Trade segment significantly restricts trading flexibility for SKFINDIA. Intraday traders will no longer be able to trade this stock, and all transactions must result in delivery, potentially reducing liquidity and trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: Investors must hold sufficient securities to sell or adequate funds to buy, as all trades require mandatory delivery. This may impact short-term trading strategies and increase capital requirements.

**Market Impact**: The inclusion in call auction during pre-open session provides price discovery through a transparent auction mechanism, which may lead to more stable opening prices but could also result in wider bid-ask spreads during the auction period.
