## Summary

STL Networks Limited will list its equity shares on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) Capital Market segment effective September 4, 2025, following approval of a Composite Scheme of Arrangement that demerges the Global Service Business (GSB) Undertaking from Sterlite Technologies Limited. Shareholders will receive 1 equity share of STL Networks Limited (face value Rs. 2) for every 1 equity share held in Sterlite Technologies Limited.

## Key Points

- New symbol: STLNETWORK will trade in 'BE' series (Trade for Trade) initially, later shifting to 'EQ' series
- ISIN: INE1VXE01018 for 487,921,086 equity shares of Rs. 2/- face value each
- Market lot size: 1 share for trading
- Securities will be included in pre-open session
- NCLT Mumbai Bench approved the scheme on February 14, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The listing is in accordance with Regulation 3.1.1 and 2.5.5 of the National Stock Exchange (Capital Market) Trading Regulations Part A. The securities will initially trade in 'BE' series as per SEBI circular SEBI/CIR/ISD/1/2010 dated September 2, 2010.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must use the designated security code STLNETWORK for trading
- Trading must be in the specified lot size of 1 share
- Securities will participate in pre-open sessions as per SEBI circulars CIR/MRD/DP/01/2012 and CIR/MRD/DP/02/2012

## Important Dates

- February 14, 2025: NCLT approval of scheme
- September 2, 2025: Circular issued
- September 4, 2025: Listing and trading commencement

## Impact Assessment

The demerger creates a separate listed entity for STL's Global Service Business, providing existing shareholders direct exposure to this business segment. The 1:1 share entitlement ensures proportionate ownership. Initial Trade for Trade segment listing may impact liquidity until migration to normal 'EQ' series. The listing expands investment options in the telecom infrastructure sector.
