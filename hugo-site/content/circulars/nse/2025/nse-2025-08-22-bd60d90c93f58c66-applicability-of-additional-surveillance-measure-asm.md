title: Applicability of Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - Long Term Framework
---

## Summary

NSE has implemented Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) on two securities - Karnika Industries Limited and Modern Threads (India) Limited - under Stage-I framework, requiring 100% margin on all positions effective August 28, 2025.

## Key Points

- Two securities placed under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I
- 100% margin applicable on all open and new positions
- No securities moving between ASM stages or to Stage-IV
- ASM is a surveillance measure, not adverse action against companies
- Price bands will be reinstated when securities exit the framework

## Regulatory Changes

- Enhanced margin requirements from normal levels to 100% for specified securities
- Securities under Stage-IV criteria would move from Rolling Settlement (EQ) to Trade-for-Trade (BE) segment, but none currently qualify

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain 100% margin for positions in KARNIKA and MODTHREAD
- Compliance with ASM framework in conjunction with other surveillance measures
- Members should refer to NSE FAQs for detailed ASM information

## Important Dates

- **August 26, 2025**: Last date for existing open positions under normal margin
- **August 28, 2025**: Effective date for 100% margin requirement on all positions

## Impact Assessment

**Securities Affected:**
- Karnika Industries Limited (KARNIKA) - INE0MGA01012
- Modern Threads (India) Limited (MODTHREAD) - INE794W01014

**Trading Impact:** Increased margin requirements will likely reduce speculative trading and improve price discovery for these securities. Market participants will need to allocate significantly more capital for positions in these stocks.
