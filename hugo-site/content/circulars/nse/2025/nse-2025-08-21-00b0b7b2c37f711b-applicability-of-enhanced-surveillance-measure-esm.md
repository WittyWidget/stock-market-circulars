---

## Summary

NSE has issued circular 645/2025 adding two securities to Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Stage I effective August 25, 2025. The affected securities will attract 100% margin requirements and be shifted from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade segment.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to ESM Stage I: KOTYARK (Kotyark Industries Limited) and USASEEDS (Upsurge Seeds Of Agriculture Limited)
- 100% margin requirement applies to all open positions as on August 22, 2025 and new positions from August 25, 2025
- Securities will shift from Rolling Settlement segment (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (BE/ST)
- No securities are being moved between stages or excluded from ESM framework
- ESM framework operates in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Addition of KOTYARK (INE0J0B01017) and USASEEDS (INE0CBM01019) to ESM Stage I
- Segment change from EQ/SM to BE/ST for the two securities
- Implementation of 100% margin requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure 100% margin coverage for existing and new positions in affected securities
- Trading in these securities will be restricted to trade-for-trade basis only
- All existing surveillance measures remain applicable

## Important Dates

- August 22, 2025: 100% margin applies to existing open positions
- August 25, 2025: New positions subject to 100% margin, segment shift to trade-for-trade effective

## Impact Assessment

- Limited impact as only two securities are affected
- Increased margin requirements may reduce speculative trading in these stocks
- Trade-for-trade settlement will require full payment/delivery, reducing leverage opportunities
- Market liquidity in these securities may decrease due to stricter trading conditions
