## Summary

NSE has updated the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework with changes to security classifications effective August 04, 2025. The circular includes securities being added to Long-Term ASM Stage-I, movements between different ASM stages, and exclusions from the ASM framework.

## Key Points

- Two securities added to Long-Term ASM Framework Stage-I: ORTIN GLOBAL LIMITED and Stallion India Fluorochemicals Limited
- ORTIN GLOBAL LIMITED moved from Short-Term ASM (STASM) to Long-Term ASM (LTASM) framework
- Two securities moved from Long-Term ASM Stage-IV to Stage-III: JSW Holdings Limited and Kitex Garments Limited
- Two securities excluded from ASM framework: DUDIGITAL GLOBAL LIMITED and Medico Remedies Limited
- Securities in Stage-IV under Criteria VII will be shifted from Rolling Settlement (EQ series) to Trade for Trade (BE series) on T+3 basis

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of Long-Term ASM Framework with staged surveillance measures
- Movement of securities between different surveillance stages based on performance criteria
- Exclusion mechanism for securities that no longer meet ASM criteria
- Trade settlement changes for Stage-IV securities under specific criteria

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with enhanced surveillance measures for listed securities
- Securities in Stage-IV under Criteria VII will have modified settlement procedures (T+3 Trade for Trade)
- Brokers and investors must be aware of surveillance status changes for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 04, 2025 - All ASM framework changes take effect
