## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative circular with minimal market impact. The ESOP allotments represent small percentages of the total outstanding shares of these well-established companies. The absence of lock-in periods means immediate liquidity, but the quantities are too small to materially affect stock prices or trading volumes. This reflects normal corporate activity related to employee compensation and has no implications for regulatory compliance or trading procedures.
