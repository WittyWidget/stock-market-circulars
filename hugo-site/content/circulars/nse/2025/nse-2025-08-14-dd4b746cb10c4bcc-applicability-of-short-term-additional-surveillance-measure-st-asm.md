## Summary

NSE has applied Short-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Stage I to 5 securities effective August 19, 2025. The measure imposes a minimum margin requirement of 50% or existing margin (whichever is higher), capped at maximum 100%, on all open positions and new positions.

## Key Points

- Margin requirement increased to minimum 50% or existing margin, whichever is higher
- Maximum margin capped at 100%

- One security (ESFL) excluded from ASM framework

## Regulatory Changes

- Framework operates in conjunction with other existing surveillance measures

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with enhanced margin requirements
- Applicable to all open positions as on August 18, 2025

- **August 18, 2025**: Cut-off date for existing positions
