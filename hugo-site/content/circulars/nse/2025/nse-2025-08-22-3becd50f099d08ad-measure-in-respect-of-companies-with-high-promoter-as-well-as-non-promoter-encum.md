---

## Summary

NSE has updated its surveillance measure for companies with high promoter and non-promoter encumbrance under Regulation 28(3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulation 2011. Tourism Finance Corporation of India Limited (TFCILTD) has been added to the framework, requiring 75% minimum margin in equity and equity derivatives segments.

## Key Points

- Tourism Finance Corporation of India Limited (TFCILTD) added to surveillance framework
- 75% minimum margin requirement applies to both equity and equity derivatives segments
- No securities excluded from the measure in this update
- Consolidated list now contains 6 securities under the framework
- Measure applies in conjunction with other prevailing exchange measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Addition of TFCILTD (ISIN: INE305A01015) to high encumbrance surveillance measure
- Continued application of 75% margin requirement for all securities under this framework
- Framework subject to periodic review by the exchange

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure 75% margin on all open positions for listed securities
- Margin requirement applies to new positions created from August 28, 2025
- Compliance required for both equity and equity derivatives segments

## Important Dates

- **August 25, 2025**: TFCILTD becomes eligible for inclusion in surveillance measure
- **August 26, 2025**: Cut-off date for existing open positions
- **August 28, 2025**: 75% margin requirement becomes effective for TFCILTD

## Impact Assessment

The addition of TFCILTD to the surveillance framework will increase trading costs and reduce leverage availability for this security. The 75% margin requirement significantly limits speculative trading and may reduce liquidity. Current framework affects 6 securities total, indicating focused application to specific high-risk encumbrance situations.
