## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must take note of the debarred entities and ensure compliance
- The debarred entities cannot access securities market or deal in securities in any manner during the debarment period
- If the debarred entities have open positions in exchange traded derivative contracts as on the order date, they can close out/square off such positions within 3 months from the order date or at contract expiry, whichever is earlier
- Updated consolidated list of debarred entities is available at: https://www.nseindia.com/regulations/member-sebi-debarred-entities

## Important Dates

- **SEBI Order Date:** October 23, 2025
- **NSE Circular Date:** October 24, 2025
- **Debarment Effective From:** October 23, 2025 (date of SEBI order)
- **Derivative Position Closure Deadline:** Within 3 months from order date or contract expiry, whichever is earlier

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects specific individuals and HUFs rather than institutional players or broader market operations.

**Regulatory Significance:** High - demonstrates SEBI's continued vigilance against front running practices and market manipulation. The varying debarment periods (1-3 years) indicate differentiated culpability among the entities.

**Compliance Impact:** NSE members must update their systems to prevent these entities from trading. The allowance for closing existing derivative positions within 3 months provides an orderly exit mechanism to prevent market disruption.
