  (GSM)
---

## Summary

The National Stock Exchange has moved Gujarat Lease Financing Limited (GLFL) to Stage I of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework effective October 17, 2025. This action imposes enhanced trading restrictions including 100% margin requirements and a 5% price band to protect market participants from elevated risk associated with this security.

## Key Points

- Gujarat Lease Financing Limited (GLFL, ISIN: INE540A01017) will move to Stage I of GSM from October 17, 2025
- Trading will be subject to 100% applicable margin rate
- Price band restricted to 5% or lower as applicable
- Members advised to take adequate precaution while trading in this security
- This circular continues the GSM framework established through previous circulars dating back to February 2017

## Regulatory Changes

The security GLFL is being placed under enhanced surveillance under the GSM framework. The GSM has four stages with progressively stricter measures:

- **Stage I**: 100% margin rate and 5% price band
- **Stage II**: Trade for trade basis with 5% price band and 50% Additional Surveillance Deposit (ASD)
- **Stage III**: Trade for trade with 5% price band, weekly trading only (Mondays), and 100% ASD
- **Stage IV**: Trade for trade with 5% price band, weekly trading only (Mondays), 100% ASD, and no upward movement allowed

## Compliance Requirements

- NSE members must apply 100% margin requirements for GLFL trades
- Members must enforce the 5% price band restriction
- Members should exercise adequate precaution and due diligence when facilitating trades in GLFL
- Members can direct queries to surveillance@nse.co.in

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 16, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 17, 2025 (GSM Stage I measures become applicable for GLFL)

## Impact Assessment

The placement of GLFL in Stage I GSM indicates NSE has identified elevated risk factors warranting enhanced surveillance. The 100% margin requirement significantly increases the capital requirement for trading this security, which will likely reduce trading volumes and liquidity. The 5% price band limits daily price volatility, protecting investors from extreme price movements. Traders and investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before trading in this security. This measure serves as an early warning system within the GSM framework, with potential escalation to higher stages if risk factors persist or worsen.
