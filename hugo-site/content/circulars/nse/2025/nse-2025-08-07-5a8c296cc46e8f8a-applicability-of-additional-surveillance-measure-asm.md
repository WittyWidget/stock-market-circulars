title: Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) - Long Term Framework Implementation
---

## Summary

NSE has implemented Long-Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) for two securities effective August 12, 2025. BGR Energy Systems Limited and MIRC Electronics Limited will be subject to 100% margin requirements on all positions and shifted to Trade-for-Trade segment if they meet Stage IV criteria.

## Key Points

- Two securities shortlisted under Long-Term ASM Framework Stage I: BGRENERGY and MIRCELECTR
- 100% margin requirement applicable on all open positions as of August 11, 2025 and new positions from August 12, 2025
- Securities qualifying under Criteria VII (Stage IV) will shift from Rolling Settlement (EQ) to Trade-for-Trade (BE) segment
- ASM framework operates in conjunction with other prevailing surveillance measures
- Shortlisting is purely for market surveillance and not an adverse action against companies

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of Long-Term ASM with enhanced margin requirements
- Potential segment migration from Rolling Settlement to Trade-for-Trade for Stage IV securities
- Enhanced surveillance monitoring for listed securities

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must maintain 100% margins for positions in affected securities
- Compliance with Trade-for-Trade settlement mechanism if securities are shifted to BE segment
- Adherence to all existing surveillance measures alongside ASM framework

## Important Dates

- **August 7, 2025**: Circular issuance date
- **August 8, 2025**: Effective date for ASM Stage I inclusion
- **August 11, 2025**: Last day for existing margin rates on open positions
- **August 12, 2025**: 100% margin requirement becomes effective
- **T+3 basis**: Timeline for segment shift implementation (if applicable)

## Impact Assessment

- **Trading Impact**: Significantly increased margin requirements will raise trading costs and may reduce speculative activity
- **Liquidity Impact**: 100% margin requirement likely to reduce trading volumes and market liquidity for affected securities
- **Market Participants**: Higher capital requirements for maintaining positions in BGRENERGY and MIRCELECTR
- **Operational Impact**: Potential segment migration will change settlement mechanisms and trading procedures
