---

## Summary

NSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework, adding three securities to Stage-I and moving several securities between different ESM stages. The changes include shifting securities from rolling settlement to trade-for-trade segment and implementing 100% margin requirements.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities added to ESM Stage-I: Gujarat Apollo Industries, Ideal Technoplast Industries, and Lotus Eye Hospital
- Securities in ESM Stage-I will attract minimum 100% margin on all positions
- Affected securities will move from Rolling Settlement (EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade (BE/ST) segment
- Securities moving to Stage-II will be under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- ESM framework works in conjunction with other surveillance measures

## Regulatory Changes

- Securities under ESM Stage-I will shift from Rolling Settlement segment (Series: EQ/SM) to Trade-for-Trade segment (Series: BE/ST)
- Securities moving to Stage-II will have 2% price band restriction under Periodic Call Auction
- Price bands will be reinstated to original levels when securities move out of the framework

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must apply minimum 100% margin on all open and new positions for ESM Stage-I securities
- Market participants must comply with trade-for-trade settlement requirements
- All existing surveillance measures remain applicable alongside ESM

## Important Dates

- **September 1, 2025**: Securities moving to Stage-II come under Trade-for-Trade with 2% price band under Periodic Call Auction
- **September 2, 2025**: ESM Stage-I securities attract 100% margin requirement and shift to Trade-for-Trade segment

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact Securities (New ESM Stage-I):**
- Gujarat Apollo Industries Limited (GUJAPOLLO)
- Ideal Technoplast Industries Limited (IDEALTECHO) 
- Lotus Eye Hospital and Institute Limited (LOTUSEYE)

**Medium Impact Securities (Stage Movement):**
- BIL VYAPAR LIMITED (BILVYAPAR) - Stage-II to Stage-I
- Chamunda Electrical Limited (CHAMUNDA) - Stage-II to Stage-I
- Giriraj Civil Developers Limited (GIRIRAJ) - Stage-II to Stage-I

The measures will increase trading costs and reduce liquidity for affected securities, while providing enhanced market surveillance and risk management.
