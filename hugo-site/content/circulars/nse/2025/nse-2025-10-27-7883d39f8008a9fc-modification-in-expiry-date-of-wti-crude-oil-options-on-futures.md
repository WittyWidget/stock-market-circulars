## Summary

NSE has modified the Last Trading Day (Contract Expiry) parameter for WTI Crude Oil Options on Futures contracts. The expiry date is being changed from two business days prior to the underlying futures contract expiry to seven business days prior. This revision will be applicable from November 6, 2025, for contracts expiring in December 2025 and onwards.

- Already launched contracts (Dec-25 and Jan-26) will reflect revised expiry dates in trading system on November 19, 2025 (EOD)

## Regulatory Changes

The contract specifications for WTI Crude Oil Options on Futures are being modified to provide additional time between options expiry and the underlying futures contract expiry. This increases the gap from 2 business days to 7 business days, providing more operational flexibility for market participants.

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and participants in commodity derivatives will need to adjust their trading strategies and risk management frameworks to accommodate the earlier expiry of options contracts relative to the underlying futures.

**Market Impact**: The extended gap between options expiry and futures expiry may reduce basis risk and provide better price discovery. Traders will have additional time to manage positions and execute settlement strategies.

**System Impact**: Members must ensure their trading systems are updated with the new contract specifications and expiry dates, particularly before November 20, 2025, when the revised parameters take effect for already launched contracts.

**Liquidity Impact**: The change may affect trading patterns in the final week before options expiry, potentially distributing liquidity differently across the contract lifecycle.
