title: GSM Framework Updates - Four Securities Move to Different Surveillance Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced changes in Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) classifications for four securities. One security moves to GSM Stage I, one to Stage II, and two securities advance to the more restrictive GSM Stage III.

## Key Points

- Adline Chem Lab Ltd (524604) moves to GSM Stage I
- Velan Hotels Ltd (526755) moves to GSM Stage II  
- Sinnar Bidi Udyog Ltd (509887) and Oscar Global Ltd (530173) both move to GSM Stage III
- Securities can move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM or IBC frameworks

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework applies enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions based on risk assessment. Higher GSM stages impose stricter trading conditions including:
- Additional margin requirements
- Restricted trading sessions
- Enhanced disclosure requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must comply with enhanced surveillance requirements
- Investors should be aware of additional trading restrictions
- Brokers must implement appropriate risk management measures

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: July 28, 2025
- Changes apply from the date of circular issuance

## Impact Assessment

Securities moving to higher GSM stages face increased trading restrictions and margin requirements. Stage III classification represents the highest level of surveillance with the most stringent trading conditions, affecting liquidity and investor participation for Sinnar Bidi Udyog and Oscar Global.
