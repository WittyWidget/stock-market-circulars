## Summary

Kesar Enterprises Ltd (Scrip Code: 507180) has announced the subdivision of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of face value Rs.10/- will be subdivided into ten equity shares of face value Re.1/- each, effective September 18, 2025.

- Record Date: September 18, 2025
- Subdivision Ratio: 1:10 (One Rs.10/- share becomes Ten Re.1/- shares)
- Current ISIN (INE133B01019) for Rs.10/- shares will become invalid from September 18, 2025
- New ISIN for Re.1/- shares will be communicated separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE133B01019 for Rs.10/- paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after September 18, 2025. A new ISIN number for the Re.1/- paid-up shares will be issued and communicated to the market through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

The subdivision will increase the number of shares outstanding by a factor of 10 while proportionally reducing the face value and market price per share. This corporate action typically aims to improve liquidity and make shares more accessible to retail investors. Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date.
