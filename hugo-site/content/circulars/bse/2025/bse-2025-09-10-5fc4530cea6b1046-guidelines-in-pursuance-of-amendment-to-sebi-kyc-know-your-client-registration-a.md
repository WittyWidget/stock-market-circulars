  Restrictions for Non-Validated Clients
---

## Summary

BSE has issued guidelines pursuant to SEBI KYC Registration Agency (KRA) Regulations amendments. Clients with KYC "On Hold" status from August 1-31, 2025 will be prohibited from trading and cannot square up positions effective September 22, 2025. Trading members must comply with centralized demise reporting mechanism and block transactions for deceased investors.

## Key Points

- Clients with non-validated KYC from August 1-31, 2025 cannot trade from September 22, 2025
- Open positions of non-compliant clients will expire naturally on contract expiry dates
- Exchange will flag non-compliant PANs as "Not Permitted to Trade" from September 20, 2025
- KRA-compliant clients will be permitted to trade on T+1 basis after validation
- Trading members must block debit transactions for deceased investors reported by KRAs

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of centralized mechanism for reporting investor demise through KRAs
- Simplification of KYC process and rationalization of Risk Management Framework at KRAs
- Enhanced validation requirements for both AADHAAR and Non-AADHAAR based OVD documents

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with SEBI circular SEBI/HO/OIAE/OIAE_IAD-1/P/CIR/2023/0000000163 dated October 03, 2023
- Block debit transactions and inactivate/close UCC for deceased investors based on daily KRA reports
- Monitor and process non-compliant client lists provided in specified file location
- Ensure KYC validation compliance for all client trading activities

## Important Dates

- **August 1-31, 2025**: KYC upload period for affected clients
- **September 20, 2025**: Exchange flags non-compliant PANs as Not Permitted to Trade
- **September 22, 2025**: Trading restrictions effective for non-validated clients
- **Daily basis**: KRA reports on deceased investors and compliance status updates

## Impact Assessment

- **Operational Impact**: Trading members must implement systems to process daily KRA reports and manage client restrictions
- **Client Impact**: Non-compliant clients face complete trading prohibition until KYC validation
- **Market Impact**: Potential reduction in trading volumes from restricted client access
- **Compliance Cost**: Additional monitoring and validation processes for trading members
- **Risk Management**: Enhanced investor protection through improved KYC validation and deceased investor controls
