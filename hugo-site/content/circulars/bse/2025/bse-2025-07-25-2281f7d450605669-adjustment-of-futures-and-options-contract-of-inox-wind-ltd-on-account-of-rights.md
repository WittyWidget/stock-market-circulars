The adjustments are due to the company's rights issue offering 5 equity shares for every 78 existing shares at Rs. 120 per share. The calculated adjustment factor is 0.985224, which will be applied to strike prices, futures prices, and market lots.

## Key Points

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must download updated contract master file on adjustment day
