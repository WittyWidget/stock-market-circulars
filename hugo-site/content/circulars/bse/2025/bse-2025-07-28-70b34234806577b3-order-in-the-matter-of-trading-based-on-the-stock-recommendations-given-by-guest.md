The order follows an investigation that revealed a scheme where certain entities made profits by trading on non-public information provided by guest experts before their recommendations were broadcast.

- Enablers provided trading accounts, terminals, login credentials to facilitate illegal trading
- Guest Experts: Kiran Jadhav, Ashish Kelkar, Himanshu Gupta, Mudit Goyal, and Simi Bhaumik
- Investigation found prima facie evidence of trading based on advance information from Zee Business Channel recommendations
- Guest experts had significant social media presence and appeared on various Zee Business shows

## Regulatory Changes

This order reinforces SEBI's stance against:
- Trading on non-public information related to media recommendations
- Market manipulation through coordinated trading schemes
- Misuse of media platforms for insider trading
- Aiding and abetting in securities violations

## Compliance Requirements

- Media houses and channels must ensure proper disclosure and prevent misuse of advance information
- Guest experts must maintain confidentiality of recommendations until broadcast
- Trading members must monitor suspicious trading patterns around media recommendations
- Entities must not provide trading facilities for executing trades based on non-public information

The case highlights the risks associated with trading on advance information from financial media and establishes precedent for similar violations. Market participants, especially those appearing on financial media, must ensure compliance with disclosure norms and prevent misuse of non-public information.
