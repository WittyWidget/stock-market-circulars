title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Lower Revision of Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the downward revision of Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages for 56 securities effective October 10, 2025. The securities are being moved to lower surveillance stages, indicating improved compliance or market behavior. The revisions include 7 securities moving from Stage 1 to Stage 0 (complete removal from GSM), 19 securities moving from Stage 2 to Stage 1, 10 securities moving from Stage 3 to Stage 2, 19 securities moving from Stage 4 to Stage 3, and 1 security (Aviva Industries Ltd) moving from Stage 3 to Stage 4.

## Key Points

- 56 securities are being moved to lower GSM stages
- 7 securities are being completely removed from GSM (Stage 0)
- 19 securities are moving from Stage 2 to Stage 1
- 10 securities are moving from Stage 3 to Stage 2
- 19 securities are moving from Stage 4 to Stage 3
- 1 security (Aviva Industries Ltd) is being moved to a higher stage (Stage 3 to Stage 4)
- Affected securities are across multiple groups including X, Z, B, T, XT, P, and ZP
- Lower GSM stages generally indicate reduced surveillance requirements and trading restrictions

## Regulatory Changes

The Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework applies differential surveillance and trading restrictions based on concerns related to price volatility, corporate governance issues, or other market integrity concerns. The downward revision indicates that BSE has determined these securities no longer require the same level of surveillance oversight.

Key stage transitions:
- **Stage 1 to Stage 0**: Complete removal from GSM framework (7 securities)
- **Stage 2 to Stage 1**: Reduced surveillance requirements (19 securities)
- **Stage 3 to Stage 2**: Further easing of restrictions (10 securities)
- **Stage 4 to Stage 3**: Lower surveillance level (19 securities)

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies whose securities are being downgraded to lower GSM stages should inform their stakeholders
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the revised GSM stages
- Investors should note the changed surveillance status when trading these securities
- Companies should maintain compliance standards to avoid future upward revision of GSM stages

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 10, 2025
- The revised GSM stages are applicable with immediate effect from the announcement date

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts:**
- Reduced trading restrictions for 55 securities moving to lower GSM stages
- Lower additional surveillance deposit (ASD) requirements for buyers
- Improved market perception and potentially better liquidity
- Signals regulatory confidence in improved compliance or market behavior
- May lead to increased investor interest due to lower perceived risk

**Negative Impact:**
- Aviva Industries Ltd faces increased surveillance with movement from Stage 3 to Stage 4

**Market Impact:**
- Overall positive development indicating improved market quality for affected securities
- May result in reduced volatility and improved price discovery
- Lower transaction costs for investors trading these securities
