## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine settlement auction affecting specific securities with delivery failures. The quantities are relatively small for most scrips and represent normal course settlement operations.

**Operational Impact:** Low to Medium - Affects clearing members and participants who have failed to deliver the listed securities. They need to arrange for shares through the auction mechanism.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal - This is a back-office settlement process that ensures delivery obligations are met. End investors are generally not directly affected unless they are part of the failed delivery chain.

**Sectoral Distribution:** The auction covers a diverse range of sectors with significant representation from financial services (BAJFINANCE, BAJAJFINSV, SBICARD, JIOFIN, TATACAPITAL), energy (SUZLON, RPOWER, OIL, NMDC), and industrial companies (RELIANCE, M&M, MOTHERSON).
