---

## Summary

BSE announces the discontinuation of weekly trading facility for Gangotri Textiles Limited (Scrip Code: 521176) effective September 9, 2025. This follows the completion of the mandated six-month period during which the company's shares were allowed to trade on a Trade for Trade basis in Z group only on the first trading day of every week, after being suspended for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations.

## Key Points

- Gangotri Textiles Limited (Scrip Code: 521176) will lose weekly trading facility
- Current arrangement allows trading only on first trading day of each week
- Trading is restricted to Trade for Trade basis in Z group
- Discontinuation follows completion of mandated six-month period
- Original suspension was for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations 2015

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024, specifically Chapter-VII(A) regarding penal actions for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must note the discontinuation of weekly trading facility
- No further trading will be permitted for Gangotri Textiles Limited from September 9, 2025
- For clarifications, Trading Members should contact bse.soplodr@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **August 22, 2025**: Notice issued
- **September 9, 2025**: Effective date for discontinuation of weekly trading facility
- **January 20, 2025**: Original notice (20250120-21) establishing weekly trading arrangement

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this affects only one company already under trading restrictions. The discontinuation represents the final step in the enforcement process for companies that fail to comply with SEBI LODR Regulations, effectively removing the last trading facility available to suspended entities after the mandated grace period.
