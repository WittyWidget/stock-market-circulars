## Summary

Edelweiss Mutual Fund has announced significant restrictions on subscriptions for 7 designated overseas investment schemes effective October 16, 2025. The Asset Management Company (AMC) is discontinuing new lump sum investments and switch-ins entirely, while capping new Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) and Systematic Transfer Plans (STPs) at a maximum of INR 5,000 per PAN per day. This action is being taken because the AMC's available headroom for overseas investment is nearing its threshold under the mutual fund level limit set on February 1, 2022, as per SEBI regulations. Existing systematic transactions remain unaffected.

## Key Points

- Effective Date: October 16, 2025
- New lump sum investments completely discontinued in affected schemes
- New switch-ins completely discontinued in affected schemes
- New monthly SIPs and STPs capped at maximum INR 5,000 per PAN per day
- Restriction based on transaction reporting date
- Transactions reported till October 15, 2025 before cut-off time not subject to limits
- Existing systematic transactions (SIPs/STPs) will continue unaffected
- 7 schemes affected, all with overseas investment exposure
- Action taken pursuant to SEBI letter no. SEBI/HO/OW/IMD-II/DOF3/25095/2022 dated June 17, 2022
- Related to overseas investment headroom limits at mutual fund level as of February 1, 2022

## Affected Schemes

The following 7 schemes of Edelweiss Mutual Fund are subject to these restrictions:

1. Edelweiss ASEAN Equity Off-shore Fund
2. Edelweiss Greater China Equity Off-shore Fund

4. Edelweiss Emerging Markets Opportunities Equity Offshore Fund
5. Edelweiss Europe Dynamic Equity Offshore Fund
6. Edelweiss US Value Equity Off-shore Fund
7. Edelweiss MSCI India Domestic & World Healthcare 45 Index Fund

## Regulatory Context

This action follows SEBI's clarification dated June 17, 2022, which allowed mutual funds to resume subscriptions and investments in overseas funds/securities up to the headroom available without breaching overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022 at the mutual fund level. Edelweiss Mutual Fund had previously informed investors about subscription limits through a notice cum addendum dated August 13, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Edelweiss Asset Management Limited will update the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) of affected schemes
- This notice-cum-addendum forms an integral part of the SID/KIM/Statement of Additional Information (SAI)
- The addendum overrides any conflicting provisions in existing documents
- All other provisions of scheme documents remain unchanged except as specifically modified

## Important Dates

- **October 13, 2025**: Notice dated and signed by Managing Director & CEO
- **October 15, 2025**: Last date for transactions reported before cut-off time to be exempt from restrictions
- **October 16, 2025**: Effective date for subscription restrictions

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact:**
- High impact on investors planning large investments in these overseas schemes
- Significant limitation on flexibility for new investors wanting lump sum exposure
- New systematic investors limited to maximum INR 5,000 per day, restricting ability to deploy larger amounts systematically
- Investors needing to rebalance portfolios through switch-ins will be unable to do so
- Existing SIP/STP investors unaffected, providing some stability

**Market Impact:**
- Reflects broader industry challenge with overseas investment limits at fund house level
- May lead to increased interest in competing fund houses with available overseas investment headroom
- Signals capacity constraints in India's mutual fund industry for overseas investments
- Could impact Edelweiss's ability to grow AUM in these schemes

**Operational Impact:**
- BSE StAR MF platform will need to implement transaction controls
- Systems must track INR 5,000 per PAN per day limits for new SIPs/STPs
- Distributors and advisors need to inform clients and adjust investment recommendations
- Fund house needs to monitor headroom availability for potential future relaxations

**Strategic Implications:**
- Underscores importance of regulatory limits on overseas investments for Indian mutual funds
- Highlights need for fund houses to manage overseas investment capacity proactively
- May prompt industry discussions on increasing overseas investment limits
