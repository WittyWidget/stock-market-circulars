## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The amendments represent material changes to the debenture issue structure, with a 12% increase in issue size. The significant reallocation toward general corporate purposes (Rs. 361.22 crores) and away from specific project construction indicates a strategic shift in fund deployment.

**Issuer Impact:** The increased issue size provides Lucina Land Development Limited with additional capital flexibility. The reallocation suggests potential changes in project timelines or priorities, with greater emphasis on operational flexibility through general corporate purposes allocation.

**Investor Impact:** Existing and prospective Series II debenture holders should evaluate the revised end-use, particularly the substantial allocation to general corporate purposes which provides less specificity than project-tied funding. The reduction in Project 1 construction costs from Rs. 450 crores to Rs. 250 crores (44% reduction) is noteworthy.

**Security Impact:** No changes indicated to the secured nature of the debentures, but investors should verify if the security coverage ratios are maintained with the increased issue size.
