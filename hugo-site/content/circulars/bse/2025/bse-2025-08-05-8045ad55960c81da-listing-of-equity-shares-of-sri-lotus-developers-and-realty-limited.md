- Lock-in periods vary from 30 days (anchor investors) to 3 years (foreign investors under FDI policy)
- All shares are in demat form
- Company formerly known as AKP Holdings Limited

- Various tranches with lock-in periods from August 2025 to August 2028
- Majority locked until February 2026 or August 2026

**Foreign Investor Lock-in (3 years):**

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

The lock-in arrangements will limit the immediate supply of shares in the secondary market, potentially supporting price stability post-IPO. The staggered release of locked-in shares over different periods will gradually increase tradable float, with significant releases expected in February and August 2026.
