These adjustments are part of BSE's surveillance measures to manage trading volatility in these scrips.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework introduced. This circular implements existing BSE surveillance mechanisms for managing price volatility in specific securities based on market conditions and trading patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement revised price bands in their trading systems before market opening on October 15, 2025
- All trades must comply with the new price band limits from the effective date
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 14, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 15, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Securities with tighter bands (2-5%) will experience restricted price movements, potentially reducing intraday volatility but possibly affecting liquidity. Securities moving to wider bands (20%) indicate reduced surveillance concerns. 

**Trading Impact**: Investors and traders must adjust their strategies based on new daily movement limits. Tighter bands may trigger circuit filters more frequently, while wider bands allow greater price discovery.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update risk management systems and ensure surveillance filters reflect the new price bands before market opening on October 15, 2025.
