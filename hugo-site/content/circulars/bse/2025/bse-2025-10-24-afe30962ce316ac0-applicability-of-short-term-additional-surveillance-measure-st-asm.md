## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must adhere to enhanced surveillance measures for securities listed in ST-ASM framework
- Trading in ST-ASM securities subject to specific restrictions including potential price bands, margin requirements, and settlement conditions
- Investors should be aware of heightened scrutiny and potential liquidity constraints in these securities
- Brokers and trading members must ensure appropriate risk disclosures to clients trading in ST-ASM securities
- Securities moving to other frameworks (ESM, GSM, LT-ASM) will be subject to those frameworks' specific compliance requirements

## Important Dates

- **October 27, 2025**: Effective date for all ST-ASM framework changes including additions, stage movements, and exits

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:**
The addition of 14 securities to ST-ASM will result in enhanced surveillance and potentially restrictive trading conditions including higher margin requirements, reduced position limits, or modified settlement mechanisms. This may reduce liquidity and increase trading costs for these securities.

**Market Participant Impact:**
Investors holding positions in newly added securities should expect potential margin calls and trading restrictions. The movement of Welcure Drugs & Pharmaceuticals to a higher stage indicates continued volatility concerns and will result in stricter surveillance measures.

**Systemic Impact:**
Limited systemic impact as most affected securities are small to mid-cap stocks with relatively lower trading volumes. However, the continued application of surveillance measures demonstrates BSE's proactive approach to market integrity and investor protection.

**Positive Development:**
9 securities exiting ST-ASM indicates improved price stability or migration to appropriate alternative frameworks, which may restore normal trading conditions for those stocks (except those moving to more restrictive frameworks like ESM).
