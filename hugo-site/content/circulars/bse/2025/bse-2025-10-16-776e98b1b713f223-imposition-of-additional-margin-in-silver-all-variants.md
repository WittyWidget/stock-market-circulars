## Regulatory Changes

ICCL has updated margin requirements for silver futures contracts under its risk management framework.

This represents a temporary enhancement to standard margin requirements for near-month silver contracts.

|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| SILVER | November 5, 2025 | 2.00% |
| SILVERM | October 31, 2025 | 2.00% |
| SILVERKG | October 31, 2025 | 2.00% |

## Compliance Requirements

- All clearing members and participants must ensure adequate margin funds are available to meet the enhanced 2% additional margin requirement
- Members should adjust their risk management and capital allocation systems to account for the increased margin from October 17, 2025
- Participants trading in silver futures must factor in the additional margin when calculating position limits and capital requirements
- Members are advised to inform their clients trading in these contracts about the enhanced margin requirements

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 16, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 17, 2025 (Begin of Day)
- **Contract Expiries:** October 31, 2025 (SILVERM, SILVERKG) and November 5, 2025 (SILVER)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
The 2% additional margin on silver futures will increase the capital requirements for traders holding positions in near-month silver contracts. This may lead to reduced open interest or position adjustments as traders manage their capital allocation.

**Operational Impact:**
Clearing members and brokers will need to collect additional margin from clients and ensure compliance with the enhanced requirements. Trading firms may need to adjust their risk parameters and position sizing for silver futures.

**Risk Mitigation:**
The measure is designed to enhance market stability and reduce systemic risk during the expiry period of near-month contracts, when volatility and delivery-related risks may be elevated.

**Trader Considerations:**
Traders with existing positions in the affected contracts should ensure sufficient margin availability. Those planning new positions should factor in the higher margin requirements when assessing trade viability and position sizing.
