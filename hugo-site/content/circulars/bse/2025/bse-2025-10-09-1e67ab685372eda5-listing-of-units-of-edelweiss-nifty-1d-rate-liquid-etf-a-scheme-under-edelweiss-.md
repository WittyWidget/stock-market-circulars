This listing has minimal market impact as it introduces a specialized liquid ETF product with a small initial unit base. The ETF provides investors with exposure to the Nifty 1D Rate Index, offering a low-risk investment avenue for short-term liquidity management. The presence of two designated market makers (Kanjalochana Finserve and Cholamandalam Securities) should ensure adequate liquidity.
