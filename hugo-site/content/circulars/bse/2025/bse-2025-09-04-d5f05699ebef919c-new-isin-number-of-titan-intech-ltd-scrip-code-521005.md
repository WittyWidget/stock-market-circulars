---

## Summary

BSE has assigned a new ISIN number INE807M01031 for TITAN INTECH LTD (Scrip Code: 521005) following the subdivision of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Re.1/-. The new ISIN will be effective for trades from the ex-date of September 8, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN number: INE807M01031 for TITAN INTECH LTD
- Scrip Code remains: 521005
- Share subdivision: From Rs.10/- to Re.1/- per equity share
- Ex-date for new ISIN: September 8, 2025
- Document Reference: DR-710/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

This notice implements the previously announced share subdivision communicated in Exchange Notice No. 20250828-57 dated August 28, 2025. The new ISIN facilitates proper identification and trading of the subdivided equity shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN INE807M01031 for all trades in TITAN INTECH LTD equity shares from September 8, 2025 onwards
- All trading systems and records must be updated to reflect the new ISIN for the subdivided shares

## Important Dates

- **September 8, 2025**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for trading
- **August 28, 2025**: Original subdivision announcement date

## Impact Assessment

This is a procedural change following a corporate action. Trading members need to update their systems to accommodate the new ISIN. The subdivision increases the number of shares while reducing the face value, potentially improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors. No immediate market disruption expected as this follows standard corporate action procedures.
