## Impact Assessment

This is a routine preferential allotment to promoters following warrant conversion. The issuance represents a relatively small number of shares with a complete lock-in until April 2027, ensuring no immediate market liquidity impact. The shares were issued at Rs. 87/- (Rs. 10 face value plus Rs. 77 premium), providing capital infusion to the company. As the shares are locked in and issued to promoters only, the immediate trading impact is minimal.
