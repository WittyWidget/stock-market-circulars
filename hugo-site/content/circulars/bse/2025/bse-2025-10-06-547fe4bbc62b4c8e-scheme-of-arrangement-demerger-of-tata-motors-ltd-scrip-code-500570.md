## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: 06 October 2025
- **Record Date**: 14 October 2025
- **Ex-Entitlement Date**: 14 October 2025
- **Settlement Number**: DR-735/2025-2026
- **Special Pre-open Session**: 14 October 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This is a significant corporate restructuring involving one of India's largest automobile manufacturers. The demerger separates the Commercial Vehicles Business into a standalone listed entity, affecting all TATA MOTORS shareholders who will receive proportionate shares in the new company.

**Operational Impact**: The 1:1 allotment ratio ensures no dilution for existing shareholders. The special pre-open session on the ex-date aims to ensure orderly price discovery for both entities post-demerger. Trading members and investors need to account for two separate securities in their portfolios post-demerger.

**Investor Impact**: All TML shareholders as of record date will automatically receive TMCVL shares in their demat accounts. This creates a new investment opportunity in a focused commercial vehicles entity while maintaining exposure to the passenger vehicle business through existing TML shares.
