## Compliance Requirements

Trading members of BSE are informed to note the listing of these new securities. The lock-in restrictions must be observed until the specified date of May 3, 2026.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 16, 2025
- **Date of Allotment:** September 10, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date:** October 17, 2025
- **Lock-in Period Ends:** May 3, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine preferential allotment listing with limited market impact. The shares represent additional equity capital raised by Veranda Learning Solutions Limited from non-promoter investors. The lock-in period until May 3, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded freely for approximately 6.5 months from the listing date, which limits immediate supply pressure. The listing increases the total outstanding shares of the company and may have minor dilution effects for existing shareholders.
