## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The auction involves 139 securities indicating delivery failures across multiple scrips. While routine, the volume of securities and high quantities in some cases (especially FCS Software with 141,997 shares) suggest significant settlement pressure.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and clearing members with open positions in these securities will need to participate in the auction to fulfill delivery obligations or face penalties. The wide range of scrips indicates systemic delivery issues across market segments.

**Investor Impact**: Limited direct impact on retail investors. The auction mechanism ensures settlement completion and market integrity. However, high auction quantities in certain stocks may indicate tight availability or temporary liquidity issues in those specific securities.
