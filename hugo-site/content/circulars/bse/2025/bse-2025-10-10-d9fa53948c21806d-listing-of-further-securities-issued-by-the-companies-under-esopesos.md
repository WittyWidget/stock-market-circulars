The newly issued equity shares will be available for trading from Monday, October 13, 2025. All listed shares have no lock-in period restrictions.

## Key Points

- Four companies are listing additional equity shares issued under ESOP/ESOS schemes

- Transport Corporation of India Ltd: 29,630 shares (Face Value ₹2)

- Wipro Ltd: 44,401 shares (Face Value ₹2)
- Trading commences on October 13, 2025
- No lock-in period applies to any of the listed shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed of the new securities availability for trading. No specific compliance actions required beyond normal trading operations.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: Monday, October 13, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The addition of these shares represents routine corporate activity related to employee compensation schemes. The volumes are relatively small compared to the companies' total outstanding shares.

**Shareholder Impact**: Minor dilution effect for existing shareholders across the four companies. The absence of lock-in periods means these shares are immediately tradable, though ESOP shares are typically held by employees for investment purposes.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in floating stock for these companies, unlikely to materially affect trading liquidity or price discovery.
