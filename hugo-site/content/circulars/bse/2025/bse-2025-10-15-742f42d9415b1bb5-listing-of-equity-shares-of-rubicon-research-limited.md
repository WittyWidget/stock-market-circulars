## Impact Assessment

This is a standard IPO listing with significant promoter lock-in indicating long-term commitment. The substantial portion of shares under lock-in (approximately 89% of total shares) will restrict immediate supply in the market, potentially supporting price stability in the initial trading period. The staggered lock-in expiry dates will result in gradual release of shares into the market over an 18-month period.
