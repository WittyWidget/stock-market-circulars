---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) list, moving five securities to different GSM stages. One security moved to Stage I, one to Stage III, and three securities moved to Stage IV, indicating varying levels of surveillance and trading restrictions.

## Key Points

- Galaxy Agrico Exports Ltd moved to GSM Stage I
- Dhenu Buildcon Infra Ltd moved to GSM Stage III
- Three securities moved to GSM Stage IV: Bacil Pharma Ltd, Shri Niwas Leasing And Finance Ltd, and Jyotirgamya Enterprises Ltd
- Securities marked with special symbols may move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in ESM or IBC frameworks

## Regulatory Changes

Securities placed under GSM are subject to additional surveillance measures and trading restrictions based on their respective stages. Higher stages typically involve more stringent monitoring and trading limitations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with additional surveillance requirements for these securities
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting may be required for transactions in these securities
- Investors should be aware of the increased surveillance status when trading these securities

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: July 29, 2025
