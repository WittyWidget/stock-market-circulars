title: Detailed Operational Modalities for Safer Participation of Retail Investors
  in Algorithmic Trading - Update
---

## Summary

BSE has issued detailed operational modalities for the safer participation of retail investors in algorithmic trading, implementing SEBI's circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-PoD/P/CIR/2025/0000013 dated February 4, 2025. The framework establishes comprehensive guidelines for empanelment of algo providers, registration of retail algos, and operational procedures to ensure safer algorithmic trading for retail participants.

## Key Points

- Algo orders are defined as orders generated using automated execution logic
- All algo providers offering API-based order placement facilities must be empanelled with exchanges
- Exchanges must specify empanelment criteria for algo providers
- Comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for algo testing to be implemented
- Clear roles and responsibilities defined for brokers in algo trading
- Registration process established for algos with specific circumstances requiring reapproval
- Enhanced confidentiality measures for retail algo strategies including NDAs and encrypted submissions
- Revised framework for location ID identification to incorporate algo orders from client Direct API
- Fast track registration for execution algos vs normal registration for other types

## Regulatory Changes

- Introduction of mandatory empanelment system for algo providers
- Revised location ID framework with new 14th digit validations for trading modes
- Implementation of comprehensive testing procedures for algorithmic strategies
- Enhanced data flow requirements between algo providers, brokers, and exchanges
- Stricter compliance requirements aligned with SEBI's outsourcing guidelines

## Compliance Requirements

- Algo providers must obtain exchange empanelment before offering services
- Brokers remain responsible for all orders placed through APIs
- Implementation of risk management systems for API-based orders
- Adherence to confidentiality clauses and non-disclosure agreements
- Compliance with data flow protocols while maintaining broker responsibility
- Testing and registration of all algorithmic strategies as per SOP

## Important Dates

- SEBI circular reference: February 4, 2025
- BSE implementation notice: May 6, 2025 (Notice 20250506-3)
- Turnaround times for registration to be specified by exchanges in their SOPs

## Impact Assessment

- Significantly impacts all retail investors using algorithmic trading systems
- Creates new compliance burden for algo providers requiring exchange empanelment
- Enhances market safety through structured testing and registration processes
- May initially slow algo deployment due to new registration requirements
- Strengthens investor protection through enhanced confidentiality measures
- Establishes clearer accountability framework with brokers maintaining ultimate responsibility
