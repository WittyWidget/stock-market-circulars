---

## Summary

Sundaram Mutual Fund has announced changes to the weekly frequency feature of Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) and Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) processing. Effective August 4, 2025, weekly SIP/STP requests will be processed on all working days of the week instead of the current fixed Wednesday processing.

## Key Points

- Change effective from August 4, 2025
- Applies to all schemes of Sundaram Mutual Fund
- Investors will have more flexibility in processing days
- All other terms and conditions remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

**Previous Process:**
- Weekly frequency SIP/STP requests processed only on Wednesday of every week
- If Wednesday was not a business day, processing occurred on next business day
- Investors could choose any day (Monday-Friday) but default was Wednesday

**New Process:**
- Weekly frequency SIP/STP requests will be processed on all working days of the week
- Enhanced flexibility for investors

## Compliance Requirements

- Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) will be updated
- Addendum forms integral part of scheme documents
- No action required from existing investors

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** August 4, 2025
- **Notice Date:** July 29, 2025

This is an operational enhancement that provides greater flexibility for mutual fund investors. The change improves customer service by allowing SIP/STP processing on all working days rather than restricting to Wednesdays. Impact on markets is minimal as this is purely a processing improvement for existing investment products.
