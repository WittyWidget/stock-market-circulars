## Compliance Requirements

- Stock exchanges, depositories and clearing corporations must notify members/participants
- Must disseminate information on their websites
- Must implement appropriate systems and procedures for compliance
- Must make necessary amendments to bye-laws, rules and regulations
- Must ensure system readiness through end-to-end testing

## Important Dates

- **August 18, 2025**: Date of timeline extension circular

## Impact Assessment

This affects all market participants who will need to comply with the new margin pledge/re-pledge requirements in the depository system. The delay allows depositories to complete necessary system developments and comprehensive testing to avoid operational issues.
