## Summary

BSE has published the list of broker ID cards that expired on August 31, 2025. The list contains 42 entries covering various brokerage firms and their employees whose ID cards require renewal for continued operations.

## Key Points

- 42 broker ID cards expired on August 31, 2025
- Covers employees from major brokerage firms including HDFC Securities, JM Financial, Nuvama Wealth Management, and others
- Each entry includes employee name, EP number, CLG number, and associated brokerage firm
- All listed cards have the same expiry date of August 31, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced - this is routine compliance data publication.

## Compliance Requirements

- Affected brokerage firms must ensure renewal of expired ID cards for listed employees
- Employees with expired cards may face operational restrictions until renewal is completed
- Firms must maintain updated employee registration status with BSE

## Important Dates

- **August 31, 2025**: Expiry date for all listed ID cards
- **September 3, 2025**: Publication date of expired cards list

## Impact Assessment

Medium operational impact as expired ID cards may affect day-to-day trading operations for the listed employees. Brokerage firms need to prioritize renewal processes to maintain full operational capacity. No direct market impact expected but could affect individual firm operations if renewals are delayed.
