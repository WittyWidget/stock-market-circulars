---

## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and admission for trading of further securities issued by 18 companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). These securities will be available for trading with effect from Tuesday, October 14, 2025. The total number of shares being listed is 3,135,109 across companies with varying face values ranging from Re. 1 to Rs. 10. None of the shares are under lock-in period.

## Key Points

- 18 companies are listing additional equity shares issued under ESOP/ESOS
- Total shares being listed: 3,135,109 shares
- Effective trading date: October 14, 2025
- No lock-in period applicable for any of the listed shares
- Largest issuances: Premier Energies Limited (2,220,000 shares), L&T Finance Limited (1,309,789 shares), DIGISPICE Technologies Limited (625,000 shares)
- Companies span multiple sectors including banking, insurance, technology, pharmaceuticals, and infrastructure

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard administrative notification for listing of securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the new securities for trading purposes
- Companies have fulfilled listing requirements for ESOP/ESOS issued shares
- All securities are freely tradable with no lock-in restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 13, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date:** October 14, 2025
- **Lock-in Period:** Not Applicable (NA) for all companies

## Impact Assessment

The impact is minimal on overall market operations. The additional shares represent small percentages of the respective companies' total outstanding shares. The listing of ESOP/ESOS shares is a routine corporate action that reflects employee compensation and retention strategies. Notable issuances include Premier Energies with 2.22 million shares and L&T Finance with 1.31 million shares, though these remain small relative to their market capitalizations. The absence of lock-in periods indicates immediate tradability, though actual market impact depends on whether employees choose to sell or hold their vested shares.
