title: Extension of Digital Accessibility Compliance Timelines for Investment Advisors
  and Research Analysts
---

## Summary

SEBI has extended the compliance timelines for digital accessibility requirements under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, following representations from regulated entities. The circular also updates the reporting authority for Investment Advisors (IAs) and Research Analysts (RAs) from BASL and SEBI respectively to BSE Ltd.

## Key Points

- Timeline extensions granted for all six compliance requirements under the digital accessibility circular
- Reporting authority for IAs and RAs changed to BSE Ltd for digital accessibility compliance
- Extensions range from 1 month to 6 months depending on the requirement
- Annual compliance reporting moved to next financial year for some requirements

## Regulatory Changes

- **Reporting Authority Update**: IAs and RAs must now report digital accessibility compliance to BSE Ltd instead of BASL and SEBI respectively
- **Extended Implementation Timeline**: Multiple phases of compliance now have extended deadlines to accommodate regulated entities' requests

## Compliance Requirements

1. **Compliance Report Submission**: Submit action taken report - extended to Sept 30, 2025
2. **Digital Platform List**: Submit list of digital platforms - extended to Sept 30, 2025  
3. **IAAP Certified Auditor Appointment**: Appoint accessibility professionals - extended to Dec 14, 2025
4. **Accessibility Audit Conduct**: Complete audit of digital platforms - extended to April 30, 2026
5. **Remediation**: Fix audit findings and ensure compliance - extended to July 31, 2026
6. **Annual Compliance**: Submit annual accessibility audit reports - extended to April 30, 2027

## Important Dates

- **September 30, 2025**: Compliance report and digital platform list submission deadline
- **December 14, 2025**: IAAP certified auditor appointment deadline
- **April 30, 2026**: Accessibility audit completion deadline
- **July 31, 2026**: Remediation and compliance assurance deadline
- **April 30, 2027**: First annual compliance report deadline

## Impact Assessment

The timeline extensions provide relief to regulated entities struggling to meet the original July 31, 2025 digital accessibility requirements. The centralization of IA and RA reporting to BSE Ltd may streamline the compliance process. This affects all regulated entities providing digital platforms to investors, requiring significant operational and technical changes to ensure accessibility for persons with disabilities.
