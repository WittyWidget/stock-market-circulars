## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it involves privately placed debt securities with limited quantity (500 debentures). The low credit rating (CARE B) indicates higher risk profile, making these securities relevant primarily to specialized debt investors and institutional participants in the private debt market. The monthly interest payment structure provides regular income opportunity for investors willing to accept the associated credit risk.
