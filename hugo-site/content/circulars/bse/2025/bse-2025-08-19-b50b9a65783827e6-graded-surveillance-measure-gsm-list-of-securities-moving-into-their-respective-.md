title: GSM Framework Updates - 10 Securities Move to Different Surveillance Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework affecting 10 securities. These securities are being moved to different GSM stages, which impacts their trading conditions and surveillance requirements.

## Key Points

- 10 securities are moving to different GSM stages effective immediately
- Ramchandra Leasing & Finance Ltd moves to GSM Stage 0 due to ESM Framework inclusion
- White Organic Retail Limited moves to GSM Stage I
- Mehta Securities Ltd moves to GSM Stage II
- Three securities move to GSM Stage III: Madhur Industries, Santosh Fine-Fab, and G-Tech Info-Training
- Four securities move to GSM Stage IV: Premier Capital Services, Clio Infotech, Raymed Labs, and Golden Carpets

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework provides different levels of surveillance and trading restrictions based on security performance and compliance. Securities marked with (#) are moving to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with GSM stage-specific requirements
- Enhanced due diligence may be required for securities in higher GSM stages
- Investors should be aware of additional trading restrictions that may apply

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: August 19, 2025
- Changes apply immediately to trading sessions

## Impact Assessment

The movement of securities to different GSM stages will affect their liquidity and trading patterns. Higher GSM stages typically involve stricter surveillance measures, which may impact investor participation and trading volumes for the affected securities.
