title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) effective October 27, 2025. The circular identifies 14 securities being shortlisted in the ST-ASM Framework, 1 security moving to higher stage ASM, and 9 securities moving out of the framework. The ST-ASM framework involves increased surveillance on securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or trading patterns.

## Key Points

- 14 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework effective October 27, 2025
- Welcure Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd will continue in ST-ASM but move to higher stage ASM
- 9 securities are moving out of ST-ASM Framework, including 1 due to inclusion in ESM Framework (Aptus Pharma Ltd)
- Consolidated list provided showing all securities currently under ST-ASM with their respective stages
- Securities include a mix of regular stocks and SME scrips

## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities showing concerning price movements or trading patterns over 5/15/30 day periods. Securities entering this framework face:

- Enhanced monitoring of trading activity
- Potential restrictions on trading parameters
- Graduated stages of surveillance based on continued patterns
- Possible progression to other surveillance frameworks (ESM, GSM, LT-ASM, Trade for Trade)

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure awareness of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Clients trading in these securities should be informed of the surveillance status
- Enhanced due diligence may be required for transactions in these securities
- Members must comply with any additional margin or trading restrictions applicable to ST-ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 27, 2025 - New ST-ASM classifications take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The inclusion of 14 securities in ST-ASM framework will result in enhanced surveillance and potentially reduced liquidity for these stocks. Investors may face higher margin requirements and trading restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading in the 14 newly included securities will need to adjust their trading strategies to account for surveillance measures. The exit of 9 securities from the framework provides relief to those stocks.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members need to update their systems and risk management frameworks to reflect the new ST-ASM classifications and communicate changes to affected clients.

- Bhageria Industries Ltd
- Chandni Machines Ltd
