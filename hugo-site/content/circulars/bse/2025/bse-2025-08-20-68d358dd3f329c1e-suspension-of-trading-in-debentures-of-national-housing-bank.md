## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in two series of National Housing Bank (NHB) debentures effective August 25, 2025, due to the record date being fixed for redemption and interest payment purposes.

## Key Points

- Both debentures carry 9.75% interest rate with maturity on September 10, 2025
- Record date fixed as August 25, 2025 for redemption and interest payment
- Trading members advised not to deal in these debentures from August 25, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard procedure for debenture redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease dealing in the specified NHB debentures from August 25, 2025
- Members required to take note of the suspension and inform clients accordingly

## Important Dates

- **August 25, 2025**: Record date and trading suspension commencement
- **September 10, 2025**: Debenture maturity date
