---

## Summary

Tourism Finance Corporation of India Ltd (Scrip Code: 526650) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of Rs. 10 face value will be sub-divided into five equity shares of Rs. 2 face value each, effective September 19, 2025.

## Key Points

- Sub-division ratio: 1 share of Rs. 10 becomes 5 shares of Rs. 2 each
- Record date: September 19, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE305A01015) for Rs. 10 shares will become invalid from September 19, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs. 2 shares to be announced separately
- Applies to dematerialised securities under rolling settlement

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE305A01015 with Rs. 10 paid-up value will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after September 19, 2025. A new ISIN number for the Rs. 2 paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the change in share structure and ensure proper handling of transactions post sub-division date. All transactions in the old ISIN will cease to be valid from the effective date.

## Important Dates

- Record Date: September 19, 2025
- Effective Date: September 19, 2025
- Notice Reference: DR-719/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

This is a standard corporate action that will increase the number of shares outstanding by a factor of 5 while proportionally reducing the face value. The action makes shares more affordable for retail investors and improves liquidity. Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date.
