The suspension is due to the company setting a record date for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspended for AXIS BANK LTD debentures with ISIN INE238A08385 (Code: 952965)

- Trading members instructed not to deal in these specific debentures
- Notice reference: DR-736/2025-2026

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified AXIS BANK LTD debentures (INE238A08385) from October 15, 2025
- Trading members are required to take note of the suspension and inform their clients accordingly
- All dealing activity in the mentioned debenture series must cease from the no-dealings date

## Important Dates

- **October 13, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **October 15, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **October 15, 2025**: No dealings from this date (trading suspension effective date)
- **October 30, 2025**: Expected maturity date based on debenture nomenclature (ABL-8.25%-30-10-25-PVT)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited impact as this affects only a specific series of privately placed debentures approaching maturity. The suspension is routine for securities undergoing redemption.

**Investor Impact**: Holders of these debentures will not be able to trade them from October 15, 2025. Only investors holding the debentures on the record date (October 15, 2025) will be eligible for interest payment and redemption proceeds.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to prevent execution of orders in this security. The suspension ensures proper settlement for the redemption process and prevents trading after the record date, which could cause settlement complications.

**Liquidity Impact**: Trading liquidity in this specific debenture series will be eliminated from the suspension date until redemption is completed.
