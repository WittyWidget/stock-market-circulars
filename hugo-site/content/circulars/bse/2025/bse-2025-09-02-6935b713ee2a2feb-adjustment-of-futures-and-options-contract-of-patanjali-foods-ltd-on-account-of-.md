## Summary

BSE will adjust all Futures and Options contracts for Patanjali Foods Ltd (PTFL) on September 10, 2025, following the company's announcement of a 2:1 bonus issue. The adjustment factor of 3 will be applied to strike prices, market lots, and positions, with the ex-date being September 11, 2025.

## Key Points

- Bonus issue ratio: 2 new equity shares for every 1 existing share (face value Rs. 2 each)

- Adjustment factor: 3 (calculated as (2+1)/1)
- Adjustments effective: End of day September 10, 2025
- Ex-date: September 11, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Adjustments will be made in compliance with SEBI guidelines for corporate actions affecting derivative contracts. All existing F&O positions will be automatically adjusted using the prescribed methodology.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the following adjustments:
- Strike prices will be divided by 3
- Market lots will be multiplied by 3 (from 300 to 900)
- Existing positions will be multiplied by 3
- Futures prices will be divided by 3 and rounded to nearest tick size

## Important Dates

- September 10, 2025: Adjustment implementation (end of day)
- September 11, 2025: Ex-date and Record date for bonus issue

## Impact Assessment

All existing F&O positions in Patanjali Foods Ltd will undergo mandatory adjustments. The market lot increases from 300 to 900 shares, potentially affecting margin requirements. Strike prices and futures prices will be reduced to one-third of current levels, maintaining economic equivalence while adjusting for the bonus issue.
