title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving to Different GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of five securities into different stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. The securities are being moved to stages ranging from GSM Stage I to GSM Stage IV, which involves progressively stricter surveillance and trading restrictions.

## Key Points

- Hindustan Fluorocarbons Ltd. (524013) moved to GSM Stage I
- G-Tech Info-Training Ltd. (532139) moved to GSM Stage II
- Simplex Mills Company Ltd. (533018) moved to GSM Stage III
- Dhenu Buildcon Infra Ltd. (501945) moved to GSM Stage IV
- Foundry Fuel Products Ltd. (513579) moved to GSM Stage IV
- Securities marked with (#) move to lower GSM stages due to ESM Framework inclusion
- Securities marked with ($) move to lower GSM stages due to IBC Framework inclusion

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework provides different levels of surveillance measures, with Stage IV being the most restrictive. Securities in higher GSM stages face additional compliance requirements and trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must comply with enhanced disclosure requirements based on their GSM stage
- Investors should be aware of additional trading restrictions and margin requirements
- Market participants must follow specific trading protocols for GSM securities

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: August 5, 2025
- The GSM stage changes are implemented immediately upon notification

## Impact Assessment

The movement to higher GSM stages will result in increased trading restrictions, higher margin requirements, and enhanced monitoring for the affected securities. This may impact liquidity and trading volumes for these stocks, particularly those moving to Stage IV surveillance.
