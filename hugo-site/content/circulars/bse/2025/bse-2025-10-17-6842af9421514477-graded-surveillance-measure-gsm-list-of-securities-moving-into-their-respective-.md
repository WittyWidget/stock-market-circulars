title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving to Higher GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of three securities to higher stages under the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. Photon Capital Advisors Ltd (Security Code: 509084, ISIN: INE107J01016) and Silveroak Commercials Ltd (Security Code: 512197, ISIN: INE798C01017) are being moved to GSM Stage II. Kiran Print Pack Ltd (Security Code: 531413, ISIN: INE516D01011) is being moved to GSM Stage III.

## Key Points

- Photon Capital Advisors Ltd moved to GSM Stage II
- Silveroak Commercials Ltd moved to GSM Stage II
- Kiran Print Pack Ltd moved to GSM Stage III
- Securities marked (#) may move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- Securities marked ($) may move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in IBC Framework
- Changes are as per NSE framework

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures on securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or pose concerns. Higher GSM stages typically involve:
- Reduced price bands
- Trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday trading)
- Additional margin requirements
- 100% upfront margin from clients

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with GSM stage requirements for these securities
- Investors must provide 100% upfront margin for trades in these securities
- All trades will be settled on a trade-for-trade basis
- Members must inform clients about the GSM classification and associated restrictions

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: October 17, 2025
- Effective Date: As per exchange notification (typically immediate or next trading day)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Movement to higher GSM stages significantly restricts trading activity. Stage II and Stage III securities face severe trading restrictions including mandatory trade-for-trade settlement, elimination of intraday trading, and reduced price bands.

**Investor Impact:** Existing investors in these securities will face liquidity constraints and difficulty in exiting positions. New investments require 100% upfront cash, making these securities less attractive.

**Market Perception:** GSM classification signals regulatory concerns about price volatility or manipulation, typically leading to negative market sentiment and potential further price decline.
