- Some securities moved out due to inclusion in other frameworks (LTASM/STASM)

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of updated surveillance measures under Regulation 28(3) of SEBI (SAST) Regulations 2011 for companies with high encumbrance levels. The framework monitors companies where promoter shareholding is significantly pledged or encumbered.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the updated list of securities under surveillance
- Enhanced monitoring and compliance requirements apply to securities in the framework
- Trading members should ensure appropriate risk management for listed securities
- Companies must continue to disclose encumbrance details as per SEBI requirements

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

Securities added to the framework may experience reduced liquidity and increased volatility. Securities removed from surveillance may see improved market sentiment and trading activity. The framework ensures investor protection by monitoring companies with high promoter pledging levels.
