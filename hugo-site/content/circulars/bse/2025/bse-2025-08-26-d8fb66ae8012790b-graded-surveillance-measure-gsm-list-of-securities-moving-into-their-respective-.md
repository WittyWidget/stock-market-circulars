## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 8 securities into different stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. The securities are being moved to stages I through IV based on their risk profiles, with higher stages indicating stricter surveillance and trading restrictions.

## Key Points

- 8 securities are moving to different GSM stages effective immediately
- Otco International Ltd moving to GSM Stage I (lowest surveillance level)
- International Data Management and Ecoboard Industries Ltd moving to GSM Stage II
- Pioneer Agro Extracts Ltd moving to GSM Stage III
- 4 securities (SJ Corporation, Mehta Securities, Satiate Agri, Tacent Projects) moving to GSM Stage IV (highest surveillance)
- Securities marked with special symbols may have framework changes due to ESM or IBC inclusion

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of stricter surveillance measures under the GSM framework for the listed securities. Higher GSM stages typically involve additional margin requirements, position limits, and enhanced monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Traders and investors must comply with enhanced surveillance requirements for affected securities
- Additional margin requirements may apply for positions in higher GSM stage securities
- Position limits and other trading restrictions may be applicable

## Important Dates
