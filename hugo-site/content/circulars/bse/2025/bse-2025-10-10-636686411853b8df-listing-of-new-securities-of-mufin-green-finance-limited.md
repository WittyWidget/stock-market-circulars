## Impact Assessment

This listing has minimal market impact as it represents a routine preferential allotment for capital raising purposes. The shares increase MUFIN GREEN FINANCE LIMITED's outstanding equity base by 46,40,000 shares. Lock-in restrictions ensure that a significant portion of these shares will not be available for trading until 2026-2027, limiting immediate liquidity impact. The issuance to both Promoter and Non-Promoter categories through warrant conversion indicates structured fundraising activity.
