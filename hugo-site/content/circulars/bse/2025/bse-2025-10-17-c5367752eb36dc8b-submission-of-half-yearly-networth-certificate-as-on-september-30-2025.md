## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**
All active members must ensure compliance with minimum networth requirements to maintain their trading and clearing memberships. Failure to meet networth thresholds or submit required documentation may result in suspension or restrictions on trading activities.

**Member Categories Affected:**
- High impact on banks operating in currency derivatives (Rs. 500 crores requirement)
- Medium impact on clearing members across all segments (Rs. 15 crores requirement)
- Members with margin trading facilities face enhanced requirement (Rs. 3 crores minimum)

**Compliance Burden:**
Members registered across multiple segments must ensure their networth meets the highest applicable requirement among all segments. The submission requires professional certification from chartered accountants or company secretaries, adding to compliance costs.

**Market Stability:**
Networth requirements serve as financial safeguards ensuring that members have adequate capital to meet their obligations, thereby protecting market integrity and reducing systemic risk across BSE's trading ecosystem.
