title: Monitoring of Minimum Investment Threshold under Specialized Investment Funds
  (SIF)
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued detailed guidelines for monitoring compliance with the Minimum Investment Threshold of INR 10 lakh under Specialized Investment Funds (SIF). The circular establishes a comprehensive breach management system including unit freezing, 30-day notice periods, and automatic redemption procedures for non-compliant investors.

## Key Points

- AMCs must monitor compliance with Minimum Investment Threshold on daily basis
- Active breach occurs when investor's total investment falls below INR 10 lakh due to investor-initiated transactions
- All units across investment strategies get frozen for debit upon breach detection
- 30 calendar day notice period provided to investors to rebalance investments
- Automatic redemption at next business day NAV if investor fails to comply within notice period
- Units unfrozen if investor rebalances within 30-day period

## Regulatory Changes

- Clarifies breach monitoring mechanism based on industry feedback
- Defines 'Active Breach' as fall below INR 10 lakh threshold due to investor transactions
- Establishes automatic remediation process with defined timelines
- Specifies unit freezing and unfreezing procedures

## Compliance Requirements

- **AMCs**: Implement daily monitoring systems for threshold compliance
- **AMCs**: Freeze units immediately upon breach detection
- **AMCs**: Issue 30-day rebalancing notices to non-compliant investors
- **AMCs**: Execute automatic redemptions for persistent breaches
- **RTAs and Depositories**: Implement necessary systems for circular compliance
- **All entities**: Put in place operational frameworks for breach management

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 29, 2025 (date of circular issuance)
- **Notice Period**: 30 calendar days for investor rebalancing
- **Redemption Timing**: Next immediate business day after 30th calendar day of notice period

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: High - requires significant system upgrades by AMCs, RTAs, and depositories for automated monitoring and breach management. **Investor Impact**: High - SIF investors face potential forced redemptions if unable to maintain minimum thresholds. **Market Impact**: Medium - may affect SIF liquidity patterns and investor behavior. **Compliance Cost**: High - substantial technology and process investments required across the mutual fund ecosystem.
