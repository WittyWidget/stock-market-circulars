AGS Transact Technologies Ltd (Scrip Code: 543451) has been shortlisted for Stage 0 surveillance following receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company, effective September 3, 2025. The circular also provides a consolidated list of 13+ companies currently under various stages of IBC surveillance measures.

## Key Points

- AGS Transact Technologies Ltd (543451) moved to Stage 0 surveillance under IBC framework

- Effective date: September 3, 2025
- No securities moved between Stage I and Stage II in this update
- Consolidated list includes companies like Ansal Properties, ARSS Infrastructure, and others under IBC surveillance

## Regulatory Changes

The surveillance framework under IBC includes multiple stages:
- Stage 0: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure regarding insolvency proceedings
- Stage 1: Additional Surveillance Measure for companies in Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP)
- Stage 2: Enhanced surveillance measures for companies deeper in the IBC process

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with applicable surveillance measures for AGS Transact Technologies Ltd starting September 3, 2025
- Trading members should update their systems to reflect the surveillance status
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in securities under IBC surveillance
- Compliance with additional margin requirements and trading restrictions as per BSE guidelines

## Important Dates

The surveillance measures will likely impact AGS Transact Technologies Ltd through increased trading restrictions, enhanced margin requirements, and potential reduction in liquidity. The Stage 0 designation signals early-stage insolvency concerns that may affect investor confidence. Market participants should exercise caution when dealing with securities under IBC surveillance, as these companies face significant financial distress or restructuring processes.
