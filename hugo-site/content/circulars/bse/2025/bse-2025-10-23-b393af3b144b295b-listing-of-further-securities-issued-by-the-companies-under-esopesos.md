## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements for trading members. This is an informational notice regarding the availability of new securities for trading.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 23, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: October 24, 2025
- **Lock-in Period**: None (NA for all securities)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of employee stock options that results in minor dilution of existing shareholding across the affected companies. The relatively small number of shares (largest being 935,000 shares for Devyani International) suggests limited impact on share prices and trading volumes.

**Operational Impact**: None. Trading members do not need to take any specific action. The securities will be available for normal trading through existing systems and processes.

**Shareholder Impact**: Minor dilution effect for existing shareholders of the 9 companies listed, which is a standard outcome of ESOP/ESOS schemes being exercised by employees.
