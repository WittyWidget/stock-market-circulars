## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective September 11, 2025. Ten new securities are being added to the framework, one security is moving to a higher ASM stage, and one security is moving out of the framework.

## Key Points

- 10 new securities added to LT-ASM framework
- Scan Projects Ltd moved to ASM Stage II
- BCC Fuba India Ltd moving out due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- Changes effective from September 11, 2025
- Framework includes multiple ASM stages with varying restrictions

## Regulatory Changes

Securities under LT-ASM framework are subject to additional surveillance measures including enhanced monitoring, position limits, and margin requirements. The framework operates in stages with progressively stricter measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with enhanced surveillance measures for listed securities
- Position limits and margin requirements apply to securities under LT-ASM
- Brokers must ensure compliance with additional monitoring requirements

## Important Dates

- **September 11, 2025**: Effective date for all LT-ASM framework changes

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of securities in LT-ASM framework typically results in reduced trading volumes and increased compliance requirements. Securities moving to higher stages face stricter surveillance measures, while those moving out experience relaxed restrictions.
