## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on SLB market operations as multiple securities will be unavailable for lending/borrowing during shut periods. Traders and institutional investors using these securities in SLB strategies must plan positions accordingly. The staggered dates help minimize concentrated market disruption, but participants should monitor liquidity in alternative securities during shut periods.
