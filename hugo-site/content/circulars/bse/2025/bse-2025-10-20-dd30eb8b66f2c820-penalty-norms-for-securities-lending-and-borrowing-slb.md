title: Penalty Norms for Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB)
---

## Summary

Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd (ICCL) has issued revised penalty norms for Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) participants, partially modifying circular no. 20201223-69 dated December 23, 2020. The circular establishes a tiered penalty structure for position limit violations and margin shortfalls, with penalties escalating based on frequency of violations within a calendar month.

## Key Points

- First instance of position limit violation in a calendar month attracts no penalty
- Penalties range from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 per instance based on violation frequency
- 11th instance onwards triggers referral to Member Committee in addition to monetary penalty
- Margin violations attract 0.07% per day charge plus instance-based penalties
- Violations monitored on end-of-day basis with no additional daily penalties for unclosed positions
- No penalty for violations caused by ICCL's revision of limits during the month
- Applicable taxes and charges will be levied on all penalties

## Regulatory Changes

**Position Limit Violation Penalties:**

- 1st instance: No penalty
- 2nd to 5th instance: Rs 5,000 per instance
- 6th to 10th instance: Rs 10,000 per instance
- 11th instance onwards: Rs 10,000 per instance + Referral to Member Committee

**Margin Violation Penalties:**

- 1st instance of disablement: 0.07% per day
- 2nd to 5th instance: 0.07% per day + Rs 5,000 per instance
- 6th to 10th instance: 0.07% per day + Rs 10,000 per instance
- 11th instance onwards: 0.07% per day + Rs 10,000 per instance + Referral to Member Committee

## Compliance Requirements

- SLB participants must adhere to position limits specified by ICCL at all levels (member level, financial institution level, client level)
- Participants must maintain adequate liquid assets with ICCL to cover all margin obligations at all times
- One instance counted as breach when position limit exceeded; monitored on end-of-day basis
- Participants responsible for closing out positions in violation to avoid continued non-compliance
- All penalties subject to applicable taxes and charges

## Important Dates

- Notice Date: October 20, 2025
- Effective Date: Immediate (upon circular issuance)
- Penalty cycle: Monthly basis for both position limit and margin violations
- Reference circular being modified: ICCL circular no. 20201223-69 dated December 23, 2020

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - affects all SLB participants' operational and compliance frameworks. The tiered penalty structure incentivizes immediate rectification of violations while providing leniency for first-time breaches.

**Operational Impact:** SLB participants need to strengthen monitoring systems for real-time position tracking and margin adequacy to avoid penalties. The escalation mechanism to Member Committee for repeated violations (11+ instances) poses reputational and operational risks.

**Financial Impact:** Direct cost implications through monetary penalties and daily charges on margin violations. The 0.07% per day charge on margin shortfalls can accumulate significantly if violations persist.

**Risk Management:** Enhanced compliance requirements necessitate robust risk management systems to prevent breaches at multiple levels (member, financial institution, client). Disablement from transacting in SLB segment during margin violations creates operational constraints.
