## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The 25:1 rights ratio represents substantial dilution for existing shareholders who do not participate. This aggressive rights offering may indicate capital raising requirements by the company.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will have the right to subscribe to 25 new shares for each share held, requiring significant capital commitment to maintain proportional ownership. Non-participation will result in substantial dilution.

**Trading Impact**: Stock will trade on ex-rights basis from October 24, 2025, with expected price adjustment to reflect the rights entitlement separation.
