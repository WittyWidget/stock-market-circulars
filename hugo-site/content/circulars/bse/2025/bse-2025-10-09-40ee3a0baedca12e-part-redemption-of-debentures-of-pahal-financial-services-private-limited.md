## Impact Assessment

This corporate action has minimal market-wide impact as it affects only holders of specific private company debentures. The part redemption will return capital to debenture holders while reducing the outstanding face value of the securities. Trading members dealing with these specific debt instruments need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face values. The impact is limited to the debt segment and does not affect broader equity markets.
