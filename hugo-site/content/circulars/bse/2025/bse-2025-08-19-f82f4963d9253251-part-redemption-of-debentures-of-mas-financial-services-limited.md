## Impact Assessment

Medium impact limited to MAS Financial Services debenture holders. The part redemption will reduce the outstanding principal amount, with MFSL-3 Months Bank MCLR series reducing to Rs. 62,500 per debenture and MFSL-1 MMCLR series reducing to Rs. 87,500 per debenture. This is a routine corporate action that provides liquidity to debenture holders while reducing the company's debt burden.
