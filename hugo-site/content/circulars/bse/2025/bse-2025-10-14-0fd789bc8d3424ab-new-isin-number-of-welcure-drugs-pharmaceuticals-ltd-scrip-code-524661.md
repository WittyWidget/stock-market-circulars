The new ISIN number INE331C01025 will be effective for all trades executed on and from October 16, 2025 (Ex-Date). This follows the company's decision to sub-divide its equity shares from a face value of Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/-.

## Key Points

- New ISIN number: INE331C01025
- Company: Welcure Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd
- Scrip Code: 524661
- Corporate action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs. 10/- to Re. 1/-
- New face value: Re. 1/- per equity share
- Ex-Date: October 16, 2025
- DR Number: 737/2025-2026
- Notice continues from previous exchange notice dated October 13, 2025 (Notice No. 20251013-18)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action implementation notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE331C01025
- All trades executed on or after October 16, 2025 must use the new ISIN
- Systems should be configured to handle the new face value of Re. 1/- per share
- Members should ensure proper tracking and settlement using the updated ISIN

## Important Dates

- **October 13, 2025**: Original notice issued (Notice No. 20251013-18)
- **October 14, 2025**: Current notice date announcing new ISIN
- **October 16, 2025**: Ex-Date - New ISIN becomes effective for trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division increases the number of shares outstanding by 10x while reducing the price per share proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members and market participants must update their systems, databases, and records with the new ISIN. Existing shareholders will see their holdings adjusted automatically, with 10 new shares of Re. 1/- for every 1 old share of Rs. 10/-.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral to Positive - While the total investment value remains unchanged, the lower price per share post-subdivision may attract more retail participation and improve trading activity.
