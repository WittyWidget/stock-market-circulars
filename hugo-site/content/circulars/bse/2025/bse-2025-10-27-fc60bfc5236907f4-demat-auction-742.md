## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 99 securities with delivery shortfalls. Large quantities in some scrips (Enbee Trade, Remedium Life, SpiceJet) may see price volatility during auction.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers with delivery obligations face potential auction losses if purchase price exceeds original transaction price. Clients with outstanding positions may face higher costs.

**Liquidity Impact:** Temporary price pressure on securities with large auction quantities, particularly smaller stocks with limited daily volumes. Blue-chip stocks like HDFC Bank and HCL Technologies likely to see minimal impact due to small quantities.
