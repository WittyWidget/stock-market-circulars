## Summary

Axis Mutual Fund has withdrawn the temporary suspension of subscriptions in Axis Silver Fund of Fund. Effective October 20, 2025, the scheme will resume accepting all applications for lumpsum investments and switch-ins. This follows Notice No. 71 dated October 13, 2025, which had temporarily suspended subscriptions. All other terms and conditions of the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) remain unchanged.

## Key Points

- Temporary suspension of subscriptions in Axis Silver Fund of Fund is being withdrawn
- Lumpsum and switch-in applications will be accepted from October 20, 2025
- Previous suspension was announced via Notice No. 71 on October 13, 2025
- All other scheme terms and conditions remain unchanged
- Notice issued by Axis Asset Management Company Limited (CIN: U65991MH2009PLC189558)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational update regarding the resumption of normal subscription operations for the scheme.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements. This notice cum addendum forms an integral part of the SID and KIM of the scheme as amended from time to time. Investors should read all scheme related documents carefully before investing.

## Important Dates

- **October 13, 2025**: Original suspension notice (Notice No. 71) issued
- **October 17, 2025**: Current notice (No. 74/2025-26) issued announcing withdrawal of suspension
- **October 20, 2025**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions (lumpsum and switch-ins)

## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it affects only investors in a specific fund of fund scheme focused on silver investments. The resumption of subscriptions allows investors to once again purchase units or switch into this scheme. The temporary nature of the suspension and its quick resolution (approximately one week) suggests routine operational management rather than any fundamental issues with the fund. Investors interested in silver exposure through mutual funds can now access this investment option again.
