**Trading Impact**: Immediate trading availability of 1,95,14,885 public shares (21.1% of total issue). Gradual unlock of anchor and promoter shares will increase float over time.

**Investor Impact**: Standard lock-in provisions protect against immediate promoter exits. Anchor investors face typical 30/90-day restrictions. Public shareholders have immediate liquidity for their allocated shares.
