## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**
SLB segment participants must adjust their operational workflows to accommodate the revised settlement schedule, particularly for the four settlements with modified timings on September 9-10. The staggered pay-in/pay-out timings on these dates require careful attention to avoid missed deadlines.

**Market Impact:**
Limited direct market impact as this is primarily an operational adjustment to align with RBI's revised settlement calendar. The changes ensure continuity of SLB operations while maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.

**Participant Action Required:**
Members must update their internal systems and processes to reflect the new settlement timings, especially for settlements falling on September 9-10, 2025, where multiple settlements occur on the same day with different timing windows.
