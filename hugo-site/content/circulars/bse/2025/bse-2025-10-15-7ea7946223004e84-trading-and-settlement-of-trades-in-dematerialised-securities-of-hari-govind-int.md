## Summary

Hari Govind International Ltd (scrip code: 531971) has completed signing agreements with both depositories (NSDL and CDSL). Effective October 16, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-737/2025-2026), the scrip will move from P group to XT group with revised trading parameters including market lot reduction from 100 to 1 share and mandatory dematerialised settlement.

## Key Points

- Market lot revised from 100 shares to 1 share
- All trades must be settled in compulsory demat form
- Netting will not be allowed in the scrip
- Shortages will be directly closed-out
- ISIN remains unchanged: INE167F01018
- Trade to Trade classification is for reasons other than non-signing of depository agreements

## Regulatory Changes

- New: XT Group (Trade to Trade) with market lot of 1 share

**Settlement Requirements:**
- Compulsory dematerialised settlement now mandatory
- No netting allowed for the scrip
- Direct close-out mechanism for shortages

## Impact Assessment
