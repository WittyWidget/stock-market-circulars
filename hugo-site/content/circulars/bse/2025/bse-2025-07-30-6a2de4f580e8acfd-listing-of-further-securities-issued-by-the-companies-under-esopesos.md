## Summary

BSE has issued a circular regarding the listing of further securities issued by companies under Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOS). The circular provides details of securities with lock-in periods expiring on August 21, 2025.

## Key Points

- Total of 3,35,590 securities are being listed under ESOP/ESOS
- All securities have a uniform lock expire date of August 21, 2025
- Securities range from small allotments of 1,000 shares to larger blocks of 1,00,000 shares
- Each security batch has specific Depository Participant (DP) ID ranges assigned

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes specified in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must ensure proper listing of ESOP/ESOS securities
- Lock-in period compliance until expiry date
- Proper maintenance of DP ID ranges for each security batch

## Important Dates

- **Lock-in Expiry Date**: August 21, 2025 (for all listed securities)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative process with minimal market impact. The listing of ESOP/ESOS securities provides liquidity to employee shareholders after the lock-in period expires. The relatively small total volume (3,35,590 shares across multiple companies) suggests limited immediate market impact.
