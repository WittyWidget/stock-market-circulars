---

## Summary

BSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective August 28, 2025, adding 3 new securities to ESM and moving 13 existing securities to higher ESM stages. No securities are moving to lower stages or exiting the framework.

## Key Points

- No securities moved to lower ESM stages
- No securities exited the ESM framework
- Consolidated list shows securities across ESM Stage I and Stage II
- Framework includes both main board and SME securities

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities that exhibit price movement patterns requiring closer monitoring. Securities in higher ESM stages face stricter trading controls and surveillance.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with enhanced surveillance measures for affected securities
- Trading in ESM securities subject to additional monitoring and restrictions
- Brokers and investors should be aware of ESM classifications when trading affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 28, 2025 - All ESM framework changes become effective

## Impact Assessment

Investors and traders dealing with these securities should expect increased scrutiny and possible impact on liquidity. The measures are designed to protect market integrity and prevent excessive speculation.
