## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Trading members need to ensure accurate data compilation across multiple parameters including collateral valuation, client balances, regulatory actions, and financial metrics. Requires coordination across multiple departments (accounts, compliance, operations).

**Compliance Impact**: Medium - Mandatory submission with specific calculation methodologies, particularly for collateral valuation and debit balance aggregation. Non-compliance may attract regulatory scrutiny.

**Market Impact**: Low - This is an internal reporting requirement and does not directly affect market operations or trading activities.

**System Impact**: Medium - Members need systems capable of aggregating data across exchanges, segments, and client accounts with proper adjustments for open bills, uncleared instruments, and margin obligations.
