## Regulatory Changes

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has amended the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018. These amendments are designed to further strengthen consumer protection against Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC). The full regulations are available on the TRAI website at https://www.trai.gov.in/release-publication/regulations.

In response to these regulatory changes, BSE has implemented the 1600 series numbering system for making outbound calls to its members.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Members:**
- Members should update their contact records to recognize the new BSE StAR Mutual Fund outbound call numbers: 1600313680 and 1600113188
- Members should ensure their phone systems and staff are aware of these legitimate contact numbers to avoid blocking important communications from BSE
- No active compliance action required beyond awareness and updating internal records

**For BSE:**
- Implementation of 1600 series numbers for all outbound calls to members in the BSE StAR Mutual Fund segment
- Compliance with TRAI's amended TCCCPR, 2018 regulations

## Important Dates

- **October 27, 2025**: Notice date and effective date for new phone numbers
- **Immediate Effect**: New outbound call numbers (1600313680/1600113188) are operational from the date of this circular

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Minimal. This is an administrative change affecting only the phone numbers used for outbound communication. The change does not affect trading operations, settlement procedures, or any business processes in the BSE StAR Mutual Fund segment.

**Member Impact:** Very low. Members need only be aware of the new numbers to recognize legitimate calls from BSE. All existing helpdesk numbers for members to contact BSE remain unchanged (022-45720450/650 and 022-69158550).

**Market Impact:** None. This change has no effect on market operations, trading activities, or mutual fund transactions.

**Compliance Impact:** This change demonstrates BSE's proactive compliance with updated TRAI regulations aimed at consumer protection. Members face no additional compliance burden beyond updating their internal records to recognize the new outbound call numbers.
