**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of short-term debt instruments that adds to the existing pool of Commercial Paper available for trading on BSE's debt segment.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to debt market participants and trading members dealing in Commercial Paper. The listing provides an additional investment option for institutional investors seeking high-rated short-term debt instruments.
