## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the additional shares available for trading
- No specific compliance actions required from members
- Updated share capital should be reflected in trading systems

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 24, 2025
- **Listing Effective Date**: October 27, 2025 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (NA for all companies)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The total number of new shares represents minor dilution for each company relative to their existing share capital. ITC's issuance of 707,230 shares is the largest but still represents a negligible percentage of its total outstanding shares.

**Trading Impact**: No significant impact expected on stock prices or trading volumes. ESOP/ESOS listings are routine corporate actions and are typically well-anticipated by the market.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in floating stock for the affected companies. None of the shares are under lock-in, making them immediately available for trading.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders may experience minimal dilution. However, ESOP/ESOS issuances are generally viewed positively as they align employee interests with shareholder value.
