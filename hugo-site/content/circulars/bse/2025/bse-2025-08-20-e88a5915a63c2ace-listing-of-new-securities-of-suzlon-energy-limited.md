## Key Points

- 14,054 equity shares of Rs. 2/- each approved for listing
- Shares result from conversion of partly paid to fully paid shares
- Issued on rights basis with ISIN INE040H01021
- Multiple distinctive number ranges allocated
- Shares are pari-passu with existing equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing approval for converted shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members permitted to trade in the new securities
- Standard trading rules and regulations apply
- Shares treated equally with existing equity shares

## Important Dates

- **Trading Commencement**: Thursday, August 21, 2025
- **Notice Date**: August 20, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this represents conversion of existing partly paid shares rather than fresh equity issuance. The relatively small number of shares (14,054) is unlikely to significantly affect Suzlon Energy's trading dynamics or market capitalization.
