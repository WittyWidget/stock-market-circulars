  5, 2025)
---

## Summary

BSE has announced special transaction processing arrangements for September 5, 2025 (Eid-e-Milad), which will be a non-business day for Debt and Liquid Funds. Subscription orders for debt, liquid, L1 and L0 category schemes will be accepted on the holiday but reported to registrars on the next business day, while redemption orders will be processed normally.

## Key Points

- September 5, 2025 declared non-business day for Debt and Liquid Funds due to Eid-e-Milad
- Subscription orders in debt, liquid, L1 and L0 schemes accepted on September 5, reported next business day
- Orders appear in Provisional Order Report with September 5 date, Order Status Report with September 8 date
- Redemption/Switch/STP orders accepted and reported normally on September 5
- Both redemption unit pay-in and pay-out processed same day for September 5 orders

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes - temporary holiday processing procedures only.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must follow modified reporting schedules for different fund categories
- Registrars to process orders according to specified timelines
- NAV applicability rules as per attached annexure (reference to BSE Notice 20250903-47)

## Important Dates

- **September 5, 2025**: Eid-e-Milad holiday, non-business day for debt/liquid funds
- **September 8, 2025**: Order date shown in Order Status Report for September 5 transactions
- Orders placed September 5 will have modified processing timelines

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on mutual fund operations with temporary processing delays for subscription orders in debt and liquid fund categories. Redemption orders maintain normal processing, minimizing liquidity disruption. Clear communication reduces operational confusion for market participants.
