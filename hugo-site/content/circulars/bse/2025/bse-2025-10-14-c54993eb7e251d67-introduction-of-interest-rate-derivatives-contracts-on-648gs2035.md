The 2035 maturity provides exposure to the medium-to-long end of the yield curve.

**Operational Impact**: Market participants trading government securities and interest rate derivatives will have new hedging and arbitrage opportunities. The alignment with NDS-OM trading hours ensures seamless integration with the existing government securities trading ecosystem.
