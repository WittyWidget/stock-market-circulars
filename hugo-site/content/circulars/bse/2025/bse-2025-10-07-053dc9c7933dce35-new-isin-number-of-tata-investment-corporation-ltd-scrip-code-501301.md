- Ex-Date: October 14, 2025
- Document Reference: DR-735/2025-2026
- Notice issued by: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President â€“ Listing Operations (CRD)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This notice implements a standard corporate action procedure for ISIN assignment following share sub-division as per existing BSE listing requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to recognize the new ISIN INE672A01026 for trades executed on or after October 14, 2025
- All trades from the ex-date onwards must use the new ISIN for equity shares of Re.1/- each
- Market participants should ensure proper mapping of old and new ISIN in their trading and settlement systems

## Important Dates

- **October 7, 2025**: Notice date
- **October 14, 2025**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for trading
- **September 24, 2025**: Date of initial notice (No. 20250924-73) regarding the sub-division

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division from Rs.10/- to Re.1/- (1:10 ratio) will result in increased liquidity and lower per-share price, making the stock more accessible to retail investors. Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants must update their systems to handle the new ISIN from the ex-date. Failure to update systems could result in trade rejections or settlement issues.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders will see their shareholding multiplied by 10 with proportionate reduction in face value. Total investment value remains unchanged. Post ex-date, the stock will trade at approximately 1/10th of the pre-split price.
