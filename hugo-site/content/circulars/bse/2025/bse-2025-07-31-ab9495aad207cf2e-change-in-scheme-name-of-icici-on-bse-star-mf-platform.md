  Prudential Children's Fund
---

## Summary

ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company Limited has announced a change in the scheme name of ICICI Prudential Child Care Fund (Gift Plan) to ICICI Prudential Children's Fund, effective August 1, 2025. This is an administrative change with no impact on the scheme's operations or provisions.

## Key Points

- Scheme name change from "ICICI Prudential Child Care Fund (Gift Plan)" to "ICICI Prudential Children's Fund"
- Change effective from August 1, 2025
- Notice-cum-addendum to Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)
- All other provisions of SID and KIM remain unchanged
- References to old name will be replaced with new name in due course

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes - this is purely an administrative name change for the mutual fund scheme.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors should note the new scheme name for future reference
- All documentation will be updated to reflect the new name
- No action required from existing investors

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 1, 2025
- **Notice Date**: July 21, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal impact as this is purely an administrative name change. Existing investors are not affected in terms of their holdings, returns, or scheme operations. The change appears to be a branding simplification from the longer "Child Care Fund (Gift Plan)" to the shorter "Children's Fund".
