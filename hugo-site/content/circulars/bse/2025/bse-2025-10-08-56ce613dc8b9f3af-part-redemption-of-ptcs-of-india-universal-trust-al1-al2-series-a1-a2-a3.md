## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects holders of six specific PTC series with substantial face value changes. Trading members need to update systems and inform clients.

**Operational Impact:** Partial redemption reduces outstanding principal on these PTCs. Investors receive partial repayment while continuing to hold securities with reduced face values. The high per-unit face values suggest these are institutional-grade debt instruments with limited retail participation.
