## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. The suspension affects a single series of debentures from a private limited company, limiting the broader market impact. However, holders of these specific debentures will be unable to trade their securities from October 17, 2025.

**Investor Impact**: Medium for affected debenture holders. Investors holding these NCDs need to be aware they cannot exit their positions after October 16, 2025. The record date determines eligibility for final interest payment and redemption proceeds.

**Operational Impact**: Standard corporate action procedure. The suspension ensures orderly settlement of redemption and interest payments to eligible holders as of the record date.
