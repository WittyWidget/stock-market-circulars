- Sparkle Gold Rock Limited moves to GSM Stage II
- Yaari Digital Integrated Services Ltd moves to GSM Stage III (as per NSE coordination)
- Securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM or IBC frameworks

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of staged surveillance measures with progressive trading restrictions based on GSM stage assignment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with GSM stage-specific trading conditions
- Enhanced due diligence requirements for transactions in GSM securities
- Adherence to position limits and margin requirements as applicable to each GSM stage

## Important Dates
