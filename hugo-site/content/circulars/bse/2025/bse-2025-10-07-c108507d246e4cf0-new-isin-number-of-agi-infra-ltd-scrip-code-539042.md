## Key Points

- Company: AGI Infra Ltd (Scrip Code: 539042)
- New ISIN: INE976R01033
- Corporate Action: Subdivision of equity shares
- Old Face Value: Rs. 5/- per share
- New Face Value: Re. 1/- per share
- Notice Reference: Continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20250923-67 dated September 23, 2025
- Demat Request Number: DR-733/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notification following a company-initiated share subdivision.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must update their systems with the new ISIN INE976R01033 for AGI Infra Ltd
- All trades executed on or after October 10, 2025 must use the new ISIN
- Investors holding shares in demat form will automatically receive subdivided shares with the new ISIN
- Trading and settlement systems must be configured to reflect the 5:1 subdivision ratio

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 07, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: October 10, 2025 (trades from this date onwards will use new ISIN)
- **Previous Notice**: September 23, 2025 (Exchange Notice No. 20250923-67)

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Trading members must update their systems before the ex-date to ensure seamless trading using the new ISIN. Failure to update may result in trade execution issues.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their holdings automatically adjusted in the 5:1 ratio (each share of Rs. 5/- becomes 5 shares of Re. 1/-). The total investment value remains unchanged, but share quantity will increase five-fold.

**Market Impact**: Share subdivision typically improves liquidity by reducing per-share price, making the stock more accessible to retail investors. No impact on company fundamentals or market capitalization.

**Operational Impact**: Depositories (NSDL/CDSL) will credit additional shares to investor accounts as per the subdivision ratio. Corporate benefits and rights will be proportionately adjusted.
