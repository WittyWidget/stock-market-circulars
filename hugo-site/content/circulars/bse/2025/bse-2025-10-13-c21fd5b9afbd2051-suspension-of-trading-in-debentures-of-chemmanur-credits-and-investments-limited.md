- **October 16, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **October 16, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited impact as this affects only two specific debenture series of one company. The suspension is temporary and for a routine corporate action (redemption and interest payment).

**Operational Impact**: Trading members holding or dealing in these debentures must halt trading activities. Investors holding these instruments will receive redemption proceeds and interest payments as per the terms.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders of record as of October 16, 2025 will receive their redemption amount and interest payment. The suspension prevents new transactions that could affect the record date determination.
