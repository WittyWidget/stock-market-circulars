title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective September 05, 2025. The circular identifies 13 securities being newly added to ST-ASM Stage I, 1 security moving to a higher ASM stage, and 5 securities moving out of the ST-ASM framework entirely.

## Key Points

- 13 securities newly shortlisted for ST-ASM Stage I framework
- 1 security (Cropster Agro Ltd) moving to higher stage ASM while continuing in ST-ASM
- 5 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework
- Changes effective from September 05, 2025
- Framework includes 5/15/30 days ASM stages
- Some securities marked with special indicators for SME and T+0 scrips

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities showing unusual price movements or trading patterns. Securities can move between different ASM stages based on their trading behavior and compliance with surveillance parameters.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with enhanced surveillance measures for listed securities
- Trading in ST-ASM securities subject to additional monitoring and restrictions
- Brokers and traders must be aware of ASM status when executing trades

## Important Dates

- **September 05, 2025**: Effective date for all ST-ASM framework changes

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of securities in ST-ASM framework typically results in:
- Enhanced monitoring of trading activities
- Potential impact on liquidity for affected securities
- Additional compliance requirements for market participants
- Possible volatility restrictions or trading limitations

Securities moving out of the framework (5 securities) will have reduced surveillance measures, potentially improving trading flexibility.
