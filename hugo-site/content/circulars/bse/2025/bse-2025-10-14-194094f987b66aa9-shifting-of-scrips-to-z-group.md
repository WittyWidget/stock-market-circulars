## Summary

BSE has announced the transfer of 8 company scrips to the 'Z' group effective October 27, 2025, as a penal measure for non-compliance with Regulation 33 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. These companies failed to file quarterly financial results for two consecutive quarters - March 2025 and June 2025. Companies have until October 20, 2025, to comply and avoid the transfer. Additionally, 37 companies already in the 'Z' group remain non-compliant for the same periods.
