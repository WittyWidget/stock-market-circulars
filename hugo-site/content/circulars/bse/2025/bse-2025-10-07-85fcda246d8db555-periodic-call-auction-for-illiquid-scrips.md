title: Periodic Call Auction for Illiquid Scrips - 49 Securities Listed
---

## Summary

BSE has announced that 49 securities will be shortlisted for trading under the periodic call auction mechanism effective October 10, 2025. This mechanism is applied to illiquid scrips to ensure orderly price discovery while managing risks associated with low trading volumes. The securities include companies from various sectors including finance, manufacturing, textiles, and trading.

## Key Points

- 49 securities identified for periodic call auction mechanism
- Effective date: October 10, 2025
- Includes companies from diverse sectors: finance, leasing, manufacturing, bio-sciences, textiles, steel, and trading
- Securities range from established companies to smaller entities with limited liquidity
- All securities listed with their Scrip Code and ISIN numbers for identification

## Regulatory Changes

The periodic call auction mechanism represents a modification to normal continuous trading for these securities. Under this system:

- Trading occurs at specific predetermined intervals rather than continuously throughout the trading session
- Helps in better price discovery for illiquid securities
- Reduces volatility and manipulation risks in low-volume stocks
- Orders are accumulated during a collection period and matched at a single equilibrium price

## Compliance Requirements

For brokers and market participants:

- Update trading systems to reflect the periodic call auction status for these 49 securities
- Inform clients holding these securities about the change in trading mechanism
- Adjust order placement strategies to align with periodic auction timings
- Ensure proper risk disclosures to clients regarding reduced liquidity

## Important Dates

- **October 10, 2025**: Effective date for periodic call auction mechanism for all 49 listed securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Trading frequency for these securities will be reduced compared to continuous trading
- May result in wider bid-ask spreads during non-auction periods
- Could impact exit opportunities for existing shareholders

**Operational Impact:**
- Investors must adjust to periodic trading windows instead of continuous access
- Order placement timing becomes critical for execution
- Price discovery limited to auction sessions

**Investor Impact:**
- Reduced liquidity may affect portfolio rebalancing strategies
