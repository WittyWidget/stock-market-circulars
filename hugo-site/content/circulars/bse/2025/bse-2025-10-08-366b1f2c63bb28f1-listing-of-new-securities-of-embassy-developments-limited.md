## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of preferential allotment shares issued to promoters. The shares are subject to lock-in until April 8, 2026, which means they cannot be traded freely in the immediate term, limiting short-term market impact.

**Shareholder Impact**: The preferential allotment increases the total equity base of Embassy Developments Limited. The shares rank pari-passu with existing shares, meaning promoter-allotted shares have equal rights.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal operational impact. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and ensure proper handling of lock-in restrictions on the newly listed securities.
