The listing provides institutional investors access to AA-rated debt instruments from Sammaan Capital Limited with competitive interest rates (9.15%-9.30% p.a.). The staggered maturity dates (2030 and 2035) offer investors different duration options. The impact is primarily limited to debt market participants and investors interested in corporate bonds with strong credit ratings.
