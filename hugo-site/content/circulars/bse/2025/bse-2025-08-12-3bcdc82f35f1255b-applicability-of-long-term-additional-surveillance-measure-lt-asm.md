title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has updated the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective August 13, 2025. The circular includes securities being newly added to LT-ASM, securities moving between different ASM stages, and securities being removed from the framework due to inclusion in other surveillance measures.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities added to Long Term ASM Framework: Indian Infotech & Software Ltd, KG Denim Ltd, and Sirohia & Sons Ltd
- 1 security (B-Right Realestate Ltd) moved to higher ASM Stage II
- 2 securities removed from LT-ASM: Avi Products India Ltd and Mirc Electronics Ltd
- Changes effective from August 13, 2025
- Consolidated list shows 15+ securities currently under various ASM stages

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework continues to be applied as a surveillance measure for securities that meet specific criteria. Securities can be moved between different stages (I, II, etc.) based on their trading patterns and compliance parameters.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under LT-ASM framework
- Enhanced surveillance measures apply to listed securities
- Securities under ASM may have additional trading restrictions
- Market participants should monitor stage changes for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **August 13, 2025**: Effective date for all LT-ASM framework changes
- All additions, removals, and stage movements become applicable from this date

## Impact Assessment

The changes affect a limited number of securities with enhanced surveillance measures. Securities moving into higher ASM stages may face increased trading restrictions, while those moving out of the framework (due to inclusion in other measures like Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, or IBC frameworks) will be subject to different regulatory oversight. The impact is moderate as it involves specific securities rather than broad market changes.
