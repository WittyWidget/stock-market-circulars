## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is a routine administrative listing of short-term commercial paper by Bajaj Financial Securities Limited for working capital and liquidity management. The instruments have short maturity periods (31 days for Series 2 and 67 days for Series 1) and carry high credit ratings (A1+), indicating strong creditworthiness. The listing provides additional short-term debt market instruments for institutional investors but does not signify any material change in market structure or trading operations.
