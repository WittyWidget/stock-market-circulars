## Impact Assessment

This takeover represents a change in control transaction for Onix Solar Energy Limited. The offer price of ₹264 per share (26.4x face value) indicates a premium pricing for the acquisition. The restricted offer size of 6.44% suggests that promoter/promoter group already holds substantial stake in the company, limiting public shareholding available for the mandatory open offer. Public shareholders have the opportunity to exit at the offer price. The involvement of multiple PACs from the Savaliya family indicates a strategic acquisition by a group with coordinated action.
