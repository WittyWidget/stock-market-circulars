## Summary

BSE has listed additional equity shares totaling 3,35,590 shares issued by companies under Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). All listed shares are subject to a lock-in period expiring on August 21, 2025.

## Key Points

- Total shares listed: 3,35,590 equity shares
- All shares issued under ESOP/ESOS arrangements
- Uniform lock-in expiry date: August 21, 2025
- Shares allocated across multiple tranches with designated serial number ranges
- Largest single tranche: 1,00,000 shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification under existing ESOP/ESOS framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must ensure compliance with lock-in provisions until August 21, 2025
- Standard ESOP/ESOS disclosure and reporting requirements apply
- Shares cannot be traded until lock-in period expires

## Important Dates

- **August 21, 2025**: Lock-in period expiry date for all listed ESOP/ESOS shares

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as these are employee stock option shares with lock-in restrictions. The shares will become tradeable after August 21, 2025, potentially increasing free float for the respective companies. Impact on individual stock prices will depend on the size relative to existing free float and market conditions at the time of lock-in expiry.
