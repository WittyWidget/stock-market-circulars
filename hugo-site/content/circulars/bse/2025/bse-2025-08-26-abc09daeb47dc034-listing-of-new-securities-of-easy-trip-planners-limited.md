- Trading members informed of new securities listing
- Lock-in restrictions apply to all issued shares
- Shares must comply with existing listing agreement terms

- **Date of Allotment**: April 12, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: August 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The preferential issue represents significant equity dilution with nearly 9.28 crore new shares entering the market. However, the 18-month lock-in period until February 2026 will prevent immediate selling pressure. This capital raise likely strengthens the company's financial position for growth initiatives in the travel technology sector.
