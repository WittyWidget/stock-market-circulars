## Summary

BSE has announced the transfer of 17 securities from the rolling settlement segment to the trade-for-trade (T2T) segment with a price band of 5% or lower, effective from October 30, 2025. This includes 16 securities moving to T/XT groups and 1 SME security moving to MT group. Additionally, 33 securities will be retained in the trade-for-trade segment with the same price band restrictions.

## Key Points

- 16 securities shifting from rolling segment (Groups X and B) to trade-for-trade segment (Groups T and XT)
- 1 SME security (Sailani Tours N Travels Ltd) moving from Group M to Group MT
- Trade-for-trade settlement means no intraday trading; delivery-based settlement only
- Price band restricted to 5% or lower for all affected securities
- 33 existing securities to be retained in trade-for-trade segment with 5% price band
- Changes implemented as surveillance measure

## Regulatory Changes

Securities moved to trade-for-trade segment will be subject to:
- Compulsory delivery-based settlement (no intraday square-off allowed)
- Maximum price movement limited to 5% or lower per trading session
- Enhanced monitoring under BSE's surveillance framework
- Securities remain in their respective groups (T, XT, MT, TS) until further review

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure delivery-based settlement for all transactions in affected securities
- Clients must have adequate funds/securities before trading in these scrips
- No intraday leveraged positions permitted
- Brokers should update their risk management systems to reflect trade-for-trade settlement requirements
- Market participants must adjust trading strategies for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 30, 2025 - Securities will move to trade-for-trade segment with 5% price band

## Impact Assessment

**Liquidity Impact**: Securities moved to trade-for-trade segment typically experience reduced trading volumes and liquidity as intraday traders exit these stocks.

**Price Discovery**: The 5% price band may slow price discovery and increase volatility around the band limits.

**Investor Base**: Shift will primarily affect day traders and intraday speculators; delivery-based investors will see minimal impact.

**Market Quality**: This surveillance measure aims to curb excessive speculation and ensure orderly price discovery in these securities.
