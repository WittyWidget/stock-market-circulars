## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification for debt securities issued by Bajaj Finance Limited. The impact is limited to debt market participants and institutional investors involved in corporate bond trading. No put/call options are attached to any of the securities. The high credit ratings (AAA/Stable from both CRISIL and ICRA) indicate low credit risk. The securities add liquidity to the corporate debt market but have minimal impact on equity markets or broader trading operations.
