## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 23, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The imposition of tighter price bands on these 28 securities will significantly limit intraday price volatility. Securities with 2% bands will experience the most restricted trading, allowing only minimal price movement in either direction during a trading session.

**Trading Impact:** Reduced price bands typically indicate that these securities are under enhanced surveillance due to concerns about price manipulation, low liquidity, or other market integrity issues. Traders and investors should exercise caution as these restrictions may:
- Limit exit opportunities during adverse price movements
- Reduce liquidity further due to trading restrictions
- Signal underlying concerns about the security's fundamentals or trading behavior
- Require multiple trading sessions to achieve significant price discovery

**Investor Consideration:** The wide variation in price bands (2% to 20%) suggests different levels of concern or risk profiles across these securities. Investors holding these stocks should be aware of the increased difficulty in executing large orders or responding quickly to market developments.
