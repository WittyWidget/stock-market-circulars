  of Bonus issue
---

## Summary

BSE will adjust all Futures & Options contracts for Patanjali Foods Ltd (PTFL) on September 10, 2025 (end of day) due to a 2:1 bonus issue. The adjustment factor of 3 will be applied to strike prices, market lots, and positions. The ex-date is September 11, 2025.

## Key Points

- Bonus ratio: 2 new equity shares for every 1 existing share (Rs. 2/- face value)
- Record date: September 11, 2025
- Adjustment factor: 3 (calculated as (2+1)/1)
- Strike prices will be divided by 3
- Market lot increases from 300 to 900 shares
- All existing positions will be multiplied by 3
- Adjustments effective end of day September 10, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Adjustments are being made in compliance with SEBI guidelines for F&O contract adjustments on corporate actions. All derivatives contracts on the underlying scrip will be modified according to the standard adjustment formula.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the adjusted contract specifications
- Strike prices to be recalculated by dividing by adjustment factor
- Position quantities to be multiplied by adjustment factor
- Market participants should adjust their systems for the new market lot size
- Contact designated Relationship Managers for clarifications

## Important Dates

- September 10, 2025: Adjustment implementation (end of day)
- September 11, 2025: Ex-date and Record date for bonus issue

## Impact Assessment

All existing F&O positions in Patanjali Foods Ltd will undergo mandatory adjustments. Strike prices will decrease to one-third of current values while contract sizes triple to maintain economic equivalence. Traders holding positions must account for the increased market lot size of 900 shares post-adjustment. The adjustment ensures contract continuity while reflecting the bonus issue's dilution effect.
