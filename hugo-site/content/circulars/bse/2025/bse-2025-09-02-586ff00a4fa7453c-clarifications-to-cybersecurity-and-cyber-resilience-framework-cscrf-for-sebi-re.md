title: Clarifications to Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) for
  SEBI Regulated Entities
---

## Summary

BSE has issued clarifications in consultation with SEBI regarding the implementation of the Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) for regulated entities. The circular provides specific guidance on determining the number of registered clients for categorization purposes and clarifies the treatment of trading members engaged in both clientele and proprietary trading.

## Key Points

- Registered clients should be counted based on Unique PAN including both active and inactive status
- Clients marked as 'Closed' in UCC database should be excluded from the count
- Trading members with clientele turnover less than 10% of proprietary turnover will be categorized as proprietary stockbrokers
- References multiple SEBI circulars including the main CSCRF circular dated August 20, 2024 and subsequent clarifications

## Regulatory Changes

The circular modifies the interpretation of 'Number of total registered clients' parameter as specified in Clause 2.1.1, Table 1 of SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/ITD-1/ITD_CSC_EXT/P/CIR/2025/60. The parameter now explicitly includes active and inactive clients based on Unique PAN while excluding closed accounts.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must count registered clients using Unique PAN methodology
- Include both active and inactive status clients in the count
- Exclude clients marked as 'Closed' in the UCC database
- Trading members engaged in both clientele and proprietary trading must assess their turnover ratio
- If clientele trading turnover is less than 10% of proprietary turnover (April 1 to March 31), categorize as proprietary stockbroker for CSCRF purposes

## Important Dates

- Original CSCRF circular: August 20, 2024
- Subsequent clarifications: December 31, 2024, March 28, 2025, April 30, 2025, August 28, 2025
- FAQ issued: June 11, 2025
- Current clarification: September 2, 2025
- Financial year assessment period: April 1 to March 31

## Impact Assessment

This clarification impacts all trading members and regulated entities implementing CSCRF guidelines. It provides crucial guidance for proper categorization which determines the applicable cybersecurity requirements. Trading members engaged in mixed business models (clientele and proprietary) can potentially benefit from simplified compliance if their clientele business is minimal (<10% of proprietary turnover).
