## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market impact as it affects only holders of FRIEZA 06 2025 PTCs. The part redemption will result in a reduced face value, and eligible PTC holders on the record date will receive interest payment along with partial redemption proceeds. Trading members need to adjust their systems for the reduced face value effective from October 31, 2025. This is a routine corporate action in the debt segment with no broader market implications.
