---

## Summary

BSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective August 13, 2025, adding 6 new securities to the surveillance list and moving 9 existing securities to higher ESM stages. The framework is designed to monitor securities with unusual price movements or trading patterns.

- 9 securities moved to higher ESM stages including Auto Pins (India) Ltd, Esha Media Research Ltd, and Espire Hospitality Limited
- No securities moved to lower ESM stages
- No securities removed from ESM framework
- Mirc Electronics Ltd marked as per NSE coordination
- Multiple SME scrips included in the updates

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework changes with three categories:
- New securities entering ESM framework
- Securities moving to higher surveillance stages
- Consolidated list showing all securities under ESM with their respective stages

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with ESM framework requirements for listed securities
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting obligations for securities under surveillance
- Adherence to specific trading conditions and margin requirements as applicable

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 13, 2025 - All ESM framework changes come into effect

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of both mainboard and SME securities indicates broad market surveillance coverage.
