- Three securities assigned 2% band (most restrictive)
- Six securities assigned 5% band
- Three securities assigned 10% band

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will impact trading volatility and liquidity in the affected securities.

Traders and investors in these securities should adjust their trading strategies accordingly.
