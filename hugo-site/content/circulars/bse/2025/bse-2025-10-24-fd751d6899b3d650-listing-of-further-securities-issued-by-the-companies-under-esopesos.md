## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for employee stock option conversions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their systems to reflect the new securities
- Companies have complied with listing requirements for ESOP share issuances
- No additional compliance actions required from market participants

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 24, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: Monday, October 27, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (NA) - no lock-in period for any securities

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The share issuances represent routine ESOP conversions and are relatively small compared to the existing share capital of these established companies. The largest issuance (ITC with 707,230 shares) is negligible relative to ITC's total outstanding shares.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible impact on stock liquidity as the number of shares being listed is small for each company.

**Dilution Impact**: Very minor dilution for existing shareholders, ranging from 0.0002% to 0.01% depending on the company's existing share capital.

**Trading Impact**: No trading restrictions or lock-in periods mean shares are immediately available for trading, but the volume is unlikely to materially affect market prices.
