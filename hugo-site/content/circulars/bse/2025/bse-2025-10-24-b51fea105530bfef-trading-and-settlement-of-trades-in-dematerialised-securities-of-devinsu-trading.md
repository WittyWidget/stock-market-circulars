title: Trading and Settlement of Trades in Dematerialised Securities of Devinsu Trading
  Ltd
---

## Summary

Devinsu Trading Ltd (scrip code: 512445) has completed signing agreements with both Depositories, enabling dematerialised settlement of trades. Effective Monday, October 27, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-743/2025-2026), the scrip will migrate from P group to XT group with revised trading and settlement modalities including change in market lot from 100 to 1 equity share and mandatory demat settlement.

## Key Points

- Scrip will be traded in Trade to Trade (XT) segment for reasons other than non-signing of agreements with depositories
- All trades must be settled in compulsory dematerialised form
- Market lot revised from 100 equity shares to 1 equity share
- Netting will not be allowed in the scrip
- Shortages will be directly closed-out
- Existing ISIN remains unchanged: INE07LH01016
- Group migration from P to XT

## Regulatory Changes

The scrip transitions from regular trading group (P) to Trade to Trade segment (XT group) with compulsory demat settlement requirements. The market lot structure has been significantly modified from 100 shares to 1 share per lot, fundamentally changing the trading mechanics for this security.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all trades in Devinsu Trading Ltd are settled in dematerialised form only
- No physical settlement will be permitted
- Netting of positions is prohibited - each trade must be settled individually
- Members must adapt systems to handle market lot of 1 equity share instead of previous 100 shares
- Shortage positions will be subject to immediate close-out procedures

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 24, 2025
- **Effective Date**: Monday, October 27, 2025
- **Settlement Number**: DR-743/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The change from market lot of 100 to 1 share significantly increases trading flexibility and accessibility for smaller investors. However, the migration to XT (Trade to Trade) segment may reduce liquidity as it restricts intraday trading and speculation.

**Settlement Impact**: Compulsory demat settlement eliminates physical certificate risk and streamlines the settlement process. The prohibition on netting increases settlement obligations for traders with multiple positions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and risk management frameworks to accommodate the new parameters, particularly the market lot change and close-out mechanism for shortages. The Trade to Trade segment classification requires enhanced monitoring and client communication regarding settlement obligations.
