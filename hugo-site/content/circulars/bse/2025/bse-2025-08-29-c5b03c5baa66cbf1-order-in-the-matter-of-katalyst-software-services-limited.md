---

## Summary

SEBI has issued an enforcement order under Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11A and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 against Katalyst Software Services Limited (KSSL) and seven individuals including promoters and directors. The order addresses a complaint filed by former promoter Rahul Dilip Shah regarding alleged collusion between Karvy Capital Limited and majority shareholders, improper pledge invocation, and issues with a proposed scheme of arrangement.

## Key Points

- KSSL is a software products and technology services company dealing in ERP, supply chain, logistics, and e-commerce domains
- Complaint filed by former promoter Rahul Dilip Shah in August 2023 alleging multiple violations
- Karvy Capital Limited declared event of default in January 2022 due to non-payment of NCD EMIs
- Pledge of shares invoked by Karvy, leading to legal challenge before Delhi High Court
- Debenture interest rate restructured from 15% to 12% post-resignation of complainant
- Proposed composite scheme of arrangement between KSSL, Nova Techset Limited, and Panacea Infotech Private Limited

## Regulatory Changes

This is an enforcement action rather than a regulatory change. The order demonstrates SEBI's continued focus on corporate governance issues and protection of minority shareholders' rights.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must ensure proper valuation procedures before pledged share sales
- Debenture trustees must act in accordance with trust deed provisions
- Scheme of arrangement requires proper disclosure and regulatory approvals
- Board interference in day-to-day operations must comply with corporate governance norms

## Important Dates

- January 2022: Event of default declared by Karvy Capital Limited
- August 29, 2023: Complaint filed with SEBI by Rahul Dilip Shah
- August 2023: Composite scheme of arrangement proposed
- August 29, 2025: SEBI order issued

## Impact Assessment

The enforcement action highlights ongoing corporate governance challenges in mid-cap companies and reinforces SEBI's commitment to protecting investor interests. The case involves complex issues around debenture defaults, pledge mechanisms, and scheme of arrangements that could set precedents for similar situations. Market participants should note the regulatory scrutiny on trustee actions and board governance practices.
