## Summary

BSE has announced the sub-division of equity shares for Sumeet Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 514211). Each existing equity share of Rs.10 face value will be sub-divided into five equity shares of Rs.2 face value each, with the record date set for October 3, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Sumeet Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 514211)
- Sub-division ratio: 1 share of Rs.10 into 5 shares of Rs.2 each
- Record date: October 3, 2025
- Effective date: October 3, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE235C01028) for Rs.10 shares will become invalid from October 3, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs.2 shares to be announced separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE235C01028 for Rs.10 paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions from October 3, 2025 onwards. A new ISIN will be assigned for the sub-divided Rs.2 shares.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the change in share structure and ensure proper handling of transactions post-subdivision. The company has set the record date for determining eligible shareholders for the sub-division.

## Important Dates

- Record Date: October 3, 2025
- Effective Date: October 3, 2025
- Notice Date: September 9, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This is a standard corporate action that will increase the number of shares in circulation while proportionally reducing the face value. The sub-division typically makes shares more affordable for retail investors and may improve liquidity. Trading will continue normally with adjusted share quantities and prices from the effective date.
