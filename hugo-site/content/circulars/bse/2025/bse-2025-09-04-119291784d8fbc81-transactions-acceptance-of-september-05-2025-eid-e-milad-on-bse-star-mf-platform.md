## Summary

BSE has issued special procedures for mutual fund transactions on September 5, 2025 (Eid-e-Milad holiday). While it will be a non-business day for Debt and Liquid Funds, subscription orders will still be accepted with modified reporting schedules.

## Key Points

- September 5, 2025 will be a non-business day for Debt and Liquid Funds due to Eid-e-Milad
- Subscription orders in Debt, Liquid, L1 and L0 category schemes will be accepted on September 5, 2025
- Orders will be reported to Registrars on the next business day
- Provisional Order Report will show order date as September 5, 2025
- Order Status Report will show order date as September 8, 2025
- All redemption, switch, and STP orders will be accepted and reported on September 5, 2025
- Both redemption unit pay-in and pay-out will be processed on the same day for September 5 orders

## Regulatory Changes

No permanent regulatory changes. This is a temporary operational adjustment for the Eid-e-Milad holiday.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must refer to BSE Notice 20250903-47 for additional guidance
- NAV applicability details are provided in the attached Annexure
- Members should adjust their operational procedures for the modified reporting schedules

## Important Dates

- September 5, 2025: Eid-e-Milad holiday - non-business day for Debt and Liquid Funds
- September 5, 2025: Subscription orders accepted but reported next business day
- September 8, 2025: Order date shown in Order Status Report for September 5 transactions

## Impact Assessment

Moderate operational impact on mutual fund platforms and participants. The acceptance of subscription orders on a non-business day provides continuity for investors while maintaining proper settlement procedures. Market participants need to adjust their systems to handle the modified reporting dates.
