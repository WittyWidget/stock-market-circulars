**Operational Impact**: Limited to debt segment traders and institutional investors dealing with Adani Enterprises' commercial paper. The high credit ratings (A1+) indicate low credit risk. Total issue size is Rs. 26.5 crores (530 Ã— Rs. 5 lakhs), which is relatively small in the context of debt markets.
