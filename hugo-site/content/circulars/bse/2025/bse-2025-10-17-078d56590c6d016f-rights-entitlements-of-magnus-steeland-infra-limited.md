## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact limited to existing shareholders and potential investors of MAGNUS STEELAND INFRA LIMITED. The Rights Entitlements mechanism allows shareholders to either subscribe to the rights issue, renounce their entitlements for value, or let them lapse. The T+1 settlement and dematerialized-only trading requirement ensures efficient settlement. Trading Members must ensure proper client communication to avoid confusion between REs and ordinary shares, and to prevent unintentional lapsing of valuable entitlements.
