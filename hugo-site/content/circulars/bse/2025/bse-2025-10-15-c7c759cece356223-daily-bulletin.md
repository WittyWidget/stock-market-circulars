## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. This is routine corporate action information that affects shareholder returns and debt instrument servicing. The bulletin is informational in nature.

**Investor Impact**: Medium. Investors holding the affected securities need to ensure their holdings are reflected in demat accounts by the record dates to claim dividends, interest, or redemption proceeds. Missing record dates would result in loss of entitlement to these payments.

**Trading Impact**: Minimal. Most securities show trading flag "1" indicating normal trading continues. Only Oberoi Realty (code 133273) and Page Industries (code 132827) show trading flag "0" indicating no delivery trading on their respective record dates.

**Financial Impact**: Positive for eligible shareholders and debenture holders who will receive dividend income and interest payments as declared.
