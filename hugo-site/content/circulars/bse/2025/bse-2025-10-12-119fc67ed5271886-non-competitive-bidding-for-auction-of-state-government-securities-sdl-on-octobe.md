The auction covers 12 securities from 9 states with a total issue size of Rs. 13,300 crores. This follows RBI's press release dated October 10, 2025, and is in continuation of BSE's circular from November 22, 2019, regarding the launch of NCB facility for SDL auctions.

## Key Points

- States covered: Bihar, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh
- Mix of new issues and re-issues with maturity periods ranging from 2029 to 2055
- Bidding through BSE's iBBS web-based NCB-GSec module
- Minimum subscription unit: 100 units (Rs. 10,000)
- Maximum bid amount ranges from Rs. 3 crores to Rs. 20 crores per security

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The Rs. 13,300 crore SDL auction provides state governments with long-term borrowing opportunities while offering debt market participants investment options in state securities with varying maturity profiles from 4 to 30 years.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and direct investors participating in debt markets need to prepare for the bidding window. The staggered deadlines (October 13 for direct investors, October 14 morning for members) require timely bid preparation and submission.

**State-wise Impact:** Maharashtra dominates with Rs. 5,000 crores across 4 securities, followed by Uttar Pradesh (Rs. 2,000 crores), and Bihar, Gujarat (Rs. 1,500 crores each). The securities offer diversification across different state credits and tenures.
