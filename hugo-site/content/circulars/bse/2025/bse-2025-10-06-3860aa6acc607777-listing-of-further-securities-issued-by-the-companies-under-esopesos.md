## Impact Assessment

The market impact is expected to be minimal given the relatively small quantities being listed. The largest addition is 107,610 shares from IIFL Capital Services Limited, representing a minor increase in freely tradable shares. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares are immediately available for trading, though the quantities are too small to materially affect liquidity or price discovery for these companies. This represents routine corporate action related to employee compensation schemes.
