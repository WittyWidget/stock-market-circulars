title: Extension of Digital Accessibility Compliance Timelines for Investment Advisors
  and Research Analysts
---

## Summary

SEBI has extended compliance timelines for digital accessibility requirements under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, following representations from regulated entities requesting more time. The circular also updates the reporting authority for Investment Advisors (IAs) and Research Analysts (RAs) from BASL and SEBI respectively to BSE Ltd.

## Key Points

- Timeline extensions granted for all six compliance requirements ranging from 1 month to next financial year
- Reporting authority for IAs and RAs changed to BSE Ltd. for digital accessibility compliance
- Extensions apply to compliance reports, digital platform lists, auditor appointments, accessibility audits, remediation, and annual compliance
- Changes made based on representations received from regulated entities

## Regulatory Changes

- **Reporting Authority Update**: IAs and RAs must now report digital accessibility compliance to BSE Ltd. instead of BASL and SEBI respectively
- **Extended Compliance Timelines**: All original deadlines have been extended with additional time periods ranging from 1 month to moving to next financial year

## Compliance Requirements

1. **Compliance Report**: Submit action taken report by September 30, 2025 (extended from August 30)
2. **Digital Platform List**: Submit list of digital platforms by September 30, 2025 (extended from August 30)
3. **IAAP Certified Auditor**: Appoint accessibility professional by December 14, 2025 (extended from September 14)
4. **Accessibility Audit**: Conduct audit by April 30, 2026 (extended from October 31, 2025)
5. **Remediation**: Complete findings remediation by July 31, 2026 (extended from January 31, 2025)
6. **Annual Compliance**: Submit annual audit reports by April 30, 2027 (moved to next financial year from April 30, 2026)

## Important Dates

- **September 30, 2025**: Compliance reports and digital platform lists due
- **December 14, 2025**: IAAP certified accessibility professional appointment deadline
- **April 30, 2026**: Accessibility audit completion deadline
- **July 31, 2026**: Remediation of audit findings deadline
- **April 30, 2027**: First annual compliance report due

## Impact Assessment

The extensions provide significant operational relief to regulated entities, allowing more time to implement digital accessibility measures. The consolidation of reporting authority for IAs and RAs under BSE Ltd. streamlines the compliance process and reduces regulatory fragmentation. This should facilitate better compliance outcomes while reducing immediate operational pressure on regulated entities.
