---

## Summary

BSE has updated its Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective August 25, 2025. The circular adds 11 new securities to the ST-ASM framework and removes 6 securities that are moving to other surveillance frameworks or trading restrictions.

## Key Points

- 11 securities newly shortlisted for ST-ASM framework including Cityman Ltd, Fundviser Capital, and KIOCL Limited
- 6 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework due to inclusion in other surveillance measures
- No securities moving between higher or lower stage ASM within ST-ASM framework
- Framework includes 5/15/30 days surveillance periods
- Special markings for SME scrips (@) and T+0 scrips (~)

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of updated Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure affecting trading in specified securities with enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with ST-ASM trading restrictions for listed securities
- Enhanced surveillance monitoring for price movements and trading volumes
- Special settlement and margin requirements may apply

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 25, 2025

## Impact Assessment
