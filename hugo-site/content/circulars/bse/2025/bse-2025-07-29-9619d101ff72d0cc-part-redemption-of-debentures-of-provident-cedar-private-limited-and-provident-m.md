## Summary

BSE has informed trading members about the partial redemption of debentures by Provident Cedar Private Limited and Provident Meryta Private Limited, resulting in reduced face values. The changes will be effective from July 30, 2025.

## Key Points

- Provident Cedar Private Limited (PCPL-17-4-28-PVT, INE0NF907031) debentures reduced to Rs. 355,865.36 per debenture
- Provident Meryta Private Limited (PMPL-ZC-30-10-29-PVT, INE0NF807025) debentures reduced to Rs. 5,000 per debenture
- Both changes are due to partial redemption of debentures
- Trading members must note the new face values for trading purposes

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for debenture partial redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new reduced face values
- Debentures must be traded at the revised face values from the effective date
- Trading members are required to take note of these changes

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 30, 2025
- **Notice Date**: July 29, 2025
- **Reference**: DR-684/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

Limited impact as this affects only specific debentures of two private companies. The partial redemption is a routine corporate action that reduces the outstanding face value of the debentures. Trading members need to update their systems but no broader market implications are expected.
