- Multiple companies receive 5% price bands including Arunjyoti Bio Ventures, Gorani Industries, and others

## Regulatory Changes

Price band modifications as surveillance measure to control excessive volatility in identified securities. These bands limit the maximum price movement allowed in a trading session.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands from September 4, 2025
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect new price band limits
- Queries should be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: September 4, 2025
- **Notice Date**: September 3, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will impact trading liquidity and volatility for the affected securities. Tighter bands (2%) will significantly restrict price movements, while wider bands (10%) allow more flexibility. The inclusion of Ola Electric Mobility with a 10% band suggests recognition of its potential for higher volatility while maintaining controlled trading.
