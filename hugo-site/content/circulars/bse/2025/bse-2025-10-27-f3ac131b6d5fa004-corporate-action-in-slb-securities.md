## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 30 actively traded securities in the SLB segment, potentially impacting liquidity for securities lending/borrowing during shut periods.

**Operational Impact:** Trading and clearing members must track multiple shut periods across different dates, requiring operational coordination to prevent non-compliant SLB contract creation.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding short positions via SLB must be aware of foreclosure requirements for amalgamation cases (Dhani Services, Mangalore Chemicals) and restricted lending/borrowing during shut periods for all dividend actions.

**Liquidity Impact:** Temporary reduction in SLB availability for these securities during shut periods, which may affect short-selling strategies and arbitrage opportunities.
