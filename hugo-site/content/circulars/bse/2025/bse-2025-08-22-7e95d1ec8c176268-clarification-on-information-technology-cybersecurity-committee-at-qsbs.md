## Summary

## Key Points

- Clarification issued based on representations from QSBs in consultation with SEBI
- Applies to the Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) requirements

## Regulatory Changes

- Modification of committee structure requirements under SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/MIRSD-PoD-1/P/CIR/2023/24 dated February 06, 2023

- Streamlined committee structure while maintaining cybersecurity expertise requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- QSBs must constitute an IT committee that includes mandatory external cybersecurity expertise
- The committee must perform all functions previously required of separate IT and cybersecurity committees
- External independent cybersecurity expert participation is mandatory
- Committee must comply with all applicable SEBI circular requirements for both IT and cybersecurity oversight

## Important Dates
