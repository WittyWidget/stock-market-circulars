## Summary

BSE has announced the listing of 21,12,994 new equity shares of Trident Texofab Limited (Scrip Code: 540726) effective from Monday, July 28, 2025. These shares were issued at a premium of Rs. 60/- per share (issue price Rs. 70/-) to non-promoters on a preferential basis through conversion of warrants. The new shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares and are subject to lock-in until January 28, 2026.

## Key Points

- 21,12,994 new equity shares of Rs. 10/- each to be listed
- Issue price: Rs. 70/- per share (Rs. 10/- face value + Rs. 60/- premium)
- Issued to non-promoters on preferential basis through warrant conversion
- Trading commences from July 28, 2025
- ISIN: INE071Y01013
- Distinguished numbers: 11854100 to 13967093
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine listing notification for new securities.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed of the new securities listing and are required to update their systems to accommodate trading in the additional shares from the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Dates**: March 17, 2025 (17,04,661 shares) and May 12, 2025 (4,08,333 shares)
- **Trading Commencement**: July 28, 2025
- **Lock-in Period Ends**: January 28, 2026

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The addition of approximately 21 lakh shares through warrant conversion represents dilution for existing shareholders but follows standard regulatory procedures. The lock-in period until January 2026 ensures these shares cannot be immediately traded by allottees, providing stability to the stock price. The preferential allotment to non-promoters indicates capital raising activity by the company.
