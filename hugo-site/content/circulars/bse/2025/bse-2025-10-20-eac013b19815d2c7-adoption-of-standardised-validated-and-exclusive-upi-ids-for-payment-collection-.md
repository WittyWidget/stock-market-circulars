## Summary

BSE has issued a Standard Operating Procedure (Version V1.1, dated August 6, 2025) for SEBI registered intermediaries to request and obtain validated, standardised, and exclusive UPI IDs for collecting payments from investors. This document implements SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/DEPA-II/DEPA-II_SRG/P/CIR/2025/86 dated June 11, 2025, and NPCI Circular NPCI/UPI/OC/217/2025-26 dated July 3, 2025. The procedure applies to brokers, depository participants (DPs), investment advisors (IAs), and research analysts (RAs).

## Key Points

- BSE provides an online portal system for intermediaries to request "At Valid" UPI IDs
- Two portals available: UAT Portal at https://membershipraia.bseindia.com/login.aspx for registered entities
- Entity information is auto-populated and non-editable based on SEBI registration certificate details
- System automatically generates unique usernames based on entity name or registered trade name
- Legal account holder can be the entity itself, the Exchange, or the Clearing Corporation
- Username generation includes options for standard, longer, or fixed-length formats
- Optional parameters can be added to customize UPI username structure
- Users can add new UPI ID requests and view status of existing requests through the portal

## Regulatory Changes

This SOP implements mandatory regulatory requirements from:
- SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/DEPA-II/DEPA-II_SRG/P/CIR/2025/86 (June 11, 2025) mandating standardised UPI IDs for SEBI registered intermediaries
- NPCI Circular NPCI/UPI/OC/217/2025-26 (July 3, 2025) providing technical framework for validated UPI IDs
- Introduces standardisation of payment collection mechanisms across all SEBI registered intermediaries
