**Liquidity Impact**: The staggered lock-in releases will gradually increase tradable float over three years, with major unlock events in 2026, 2027, and 2028. Anchor investor lock-ins expire within 3 months, adding 923,000 shares to the free float.

**Investor Impact**: Lock-in structure provides price stability in initial trading period while protecting long-term investor interests through promoter commitment.
