title: Extension of Digital Accessibility Compliance Timelines for Investment Advisers
  and Research Analysts
---

## Summary

SEBI has extended compliance timelines for digital accessibility requirements under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, following representations from regulated entities. The circular also updates reporting authorities for Investment Advisers (IAs) and Research Analysts (RAs) from BASL/SEBI to BSE Ltd.

## Key Points

- Extension granted for all six compliance requirements with timelines ranging from 1 month to next financial year
- Reporting authority for IAs and RAs changed to BSE Ltd. for both categories
- Extensions apply to submission of compliance reports, digital platform lists, auditor appointments, accessibility audits, remediation, and annual compliance
- All regulated entities can benefit from the extended timelines

## Regulatory Changes

- **Reporting Authority Update**: IAs and RAs must now report to BSE Ltd. instead of BASL and SEBI respectively
- **Timeline Extensions**: Significant extensions granted across all compliance requirements, with some extended by up to 6 months
- **Annual Compliance**: Annual accessibility audit reporting moved to next financial year (April 30, 2027)

## Compliance Requirements

1. **Compliance Report Submission**: By September 30, 2025 (extended from August 30, 2025)
2. **Digital Platform List**: By September 30, 2025 (extended from August 30, 2025)
3. **IAAP Certified Auditor Appointment**: By December 14, 2025 (extended from September 14, 2025)
4. **Accessibility Audit Conduct**: By April 30, 2026 (extended from October 31, 2025)

6. **Annual Compliance Reporting**: By April 30, 2027 (extended from April 30, 2026)

## Important Dates

- **September 30, 2025**: Deadline for compliance reports and digital platform lists

- **April 30, 2026**: Deadline for completing accessibility audits
- **July 31, 2026**: Deadline for remediation of audit findings
- **April 30, 2027**: First annual compliance report due

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impact**: The extensions provide regulated entities with more time to ensure proper compliance with digital accessibility requirements, reducing implementation pressure and allowing for better quality compliance.

**Operational Impact**: Entities need to update their compliance reporting processes to reflect the new reporting authorities, particularly IAs and RAs who must now report to BSE Ltd. instead of their previous authorities.

**Market Impact**: Limited direct market impact, but ensures better accessibility infrastructure for investors with disabilities in the long term.
