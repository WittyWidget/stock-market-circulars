SEBI has issued an ex-parte interim order under Sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B(1) of the SEBI Act, 1992 against eight entities for alleged insider trading in the scrip of Indian Energy Exchange Limited (IEX). The order follows a suo-motu preliminary examination conducted after significant fall in IEX share price following a CERC announcement on July 23, 2025 after market hours.
