## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: October 24, 2025

- **Settlement Number**: DR-742/2025-2026
- **Notice Date**: October 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**For Shareholders**: This is a highly dilutive rights issue with a 25:1 entitlement ratio, meaning the share capital will increase by 2,500% if fully subscribed. Existing shareholders must participate to avoid significant dilution of their holdings. Shareholders must hold shares before October 24, 2025 to be eligible.

**For Trading Members**: Must adjust trading systems to reflect Ex-Rights trading from October 24, 2025. All buy/sell orders executed from this date will not carry rights entitlement.

**Market Impact**: The substantial dilution potential may cause price volatility. The Ex-Rights adjustment will result in theoretical price reduction to reflect the rights value separation from the underlying share price.
