- Two mandatory undertakings must be provided: (1) appointment of audit firm/auditor and (2) declaration of penalty
- Auditor login credentials are automatically generated after member completes auditor selection
- Reports are submitted using XBRL format through a standardized Excel utility
- Members can only modify 'General Information' and 'Annexure II' sheets for management comments
- Final submission requires uploading the XBRL sheet, which is converted to PDF and must be printed on member's letterhead
