## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in four debt securities effective October 17, 2025, as they will mature on the redemption date. The affected securities include one Sovereign Gold Bond (2017 Series) and three Treasury Bills (364-day, 182-day, and 91-day variants). Trading members are advised not to deal in these securities from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Four debt securities to be suspended from trading effective October 17, 2025
- Includes Sovereign Gold Bond 2017 Series (SCRIP CODE: 800270, ISIN: IN0020170067)
- Three T-bills affected: 364TB231025, 182T231025, and 91TB231025
- Suspension due to maturity on redemption date October 23, 2025
- Notice issued under reference DR-738/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational notice for securities reaching maturity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the four specified securities from October 17, 2025 onwards
- Members should update their systems to reflect the trading suspension
- Ensure clients are informed about the suspension to prevent attempted trades

## Important Dates

- **October 16, 2025**: Notice date
- **October 17, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date
- **October 23, 2025**: Expected redemption/maturity date

## Impact Assessment

The suspension has limited market impact as it affects securities nearing maturity, which is standard market practice. Holders of these securities will receive redemption proceeds on maturity. Trading members need to ensure operational readiness to block trades in these securities. The Sovereign Gold Bond and T-bill holders should prepare for redemption settlements. No broader market disruption is anticipated as this is routine end-of-lifecycle activity for debt instruments.
