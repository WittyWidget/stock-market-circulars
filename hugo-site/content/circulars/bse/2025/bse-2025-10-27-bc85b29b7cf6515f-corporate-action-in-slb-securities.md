title: Corporate Action in SLB Securities - Dividend and Amalgamation Events
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular announcing corporate actions for 30 securities eligible for Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB). The circular includes 28 dividend declarations and 2 amalgamations, with events scheduled between October 27, 2025 and November 19, 2025. The circular specifies book closure dates, record dates, ex-dates, foreclosure dates (for amalgamations), and shut periods for SLB transactions.

## Key Points

- 28 securities declaring dividends with ex-dates ranging from October 27 to November 19, 2025
- 2 amalgamation events: Dhani Services Limited (Oct 28) and Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilisers (Oct 31)
- SLB shut periods specified for all corporate actions, typically 1-4 days
- Major companies affected include Infosys, Hindustan Unilever, Dabur, Power Grid, and REC
- Foreclosure dates applicable only for amalgamation events
- All events include specific book closure/record dates matching ex-dates

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine operational circular informing market participants of scheduled corporate actions affecting SLB securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- SLB participants must observe shut periods during which lending/borrowing of affected securities will be restricted
- Market participants should note ex-dates for dividend entitlement and amalgamation adjustments
- Foreclosure of SLB positions required for amalgamation events on specified dates
- Trading and settlement systems must reflect corporate action adjustments on ex-dates

## Important Dates

**Immediate (October 27, 2025):**
- REC Limited, TANLA Platforms, L&T Technology Services, Infosys, CESC, 360 ONE WAM, CRISIL, Central Bank of India, PCBL Chemical - Dividend ex-date

**October 28, 2025:**
- Dhani Services - Amalgamation ex-date and foreclosure

**October 31, 2025:**
- NRB Bearings, Laurus Labs, Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilisers (Amalgamation), Supreme Petrochem, COFORGE, PDS Limited - Ex-dates

**November 2025:**
- Multiple dividend ex-dates for major companies including Dabur (Nov 7), Hindustan Unilever (Nov 7), Power Grid (Nov 10), Page Industries (Nov 19)

**Historical Date:**
- Symphony Limited - August 7, 2025 (likely prior announcement)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 30 actively traded securities across various sectors including IT, FMCG, infrastructure, banking, and manufacturing. The dividend declarations are positive for shareholders but may cause temporary price adjustments on ex-dates.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - SLB participants must manage positions carefully during shut periods, potentially affecting liquidity and borrowing costs for these securities. The 1-4 day shut periods will temporarily restrict lending/borrowing activity.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders must hold securities before record dates to qualify for dividends. The amalgamation events for Dhani Services and Mangalore Chemicals & Fertilisers require special attention from investors and will result in mandatory position closures in the SLB segment on foreclosure dates.
