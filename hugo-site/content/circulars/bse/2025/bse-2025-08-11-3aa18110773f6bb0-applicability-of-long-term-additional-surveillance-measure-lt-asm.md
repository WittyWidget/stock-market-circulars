## Summary

BSE has updated the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective August 12, 2025. The circular lists securities being added to, moved within, or removed from the LT-ASM framework across different stages.

## Key Points

- One new security added to LT-ASM: Decorous Investment & Trading Co Ltd
- One security moved to higher ASM Stage II: Aryan Share and Stock Brokers Ltd
- One security moved out of LT-ASM due to ESM inclusion: Gayatri BioOrganics Ltd
- Comprehensive consolidated list of all securities currently under LT-ASM provided
- Framework includes multiple stages (I, II, etc.) with varying surveillance levels

## Regulatory Changes

- Updated LT-ASM framework lists across four categories:
  - Part A: New securities shortlisted for LT-ASM
  - Part B: Securities moved to higher ASM stages
  - Part C: Securities moved to lower ASM stages (currently nil)
  - Part D: Securities shortlisted for Direct Stage IV (currently nil)
- Securities may exit LT-ASM due to inclusion in other frameworks (Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, IBC)

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must comply with enhanced surveillance requirements
- Trading members must adhere to additional monitoring and reporting obligations
- Specific compliance varies by ASM stage assigned to each security

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** August 12, 2025
- All changes to LT-ASM framework take effect from this date

## Impact Assessment

- Enhanced surveillance may impact trading volumes and liquidity for affected securities
- Investors may face additional scrutiny and margin requirements
- Movement between ASM stages indicates regulatory assessment of security behavior
- Exit from LT-ASM (like Gayatri BioOrganics) may indicate transition to other regulatory frameworks with different implications
