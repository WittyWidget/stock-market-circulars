## Summary

BSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective August 7, 2025. Three securities - Aris International Ltd, Kreon Finnancial Services Ltd, and Skyline Millars Ltd - will move to higher ESM stages, while no new securities are being added or removed from the framework.

## Key Points

- Kreon Finnancial Services Ltd (Scrip Code: 530139, ISIN: INE302C01018)
- Skyline Millars Ltd (Scrip Code: 505650, ISIN: INE178E01026)

## ESM Framework Structure

The framework operates in multiple stages (Stage I and Stage II) with varying levels of surveillance measures. Securities marked with (*) indicate NSE alignment, while (#) denotes SME scrips.

## Impact Assessment

The ESM framework imposes enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions on listed securities. Moving to higher stages typically involves stricter surveillance measures, which may affect trading volumes and investor sentiment for the affected securities.
