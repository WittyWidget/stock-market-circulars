## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the new securities for trading
- Companies must ensure allotment details are updated in depository systems
- Standard post-listing compliance requirements apply

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 17, 2025
- **Listing and Trading Commencement**: October 20, 2025 (Monday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (NA for all companies)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal to negligible. The total issuance represents a small fraction of the outstanding equity for each company. Yes Bank's 1.24 million shares is the largest but still represents minimal dilution given the bank's large capital base.

**Liquidity Impact**: Marginal increase in free float for affected companies. Since there are no lock-in restrictions, shares are immediately available for trading.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral. ESOP issuances are routine corporate actions that reflect employee compensation and retention strategies. No immediate price impact expected.

**Operational Impact**: Routine processing for trading members and depositories. No special handling required.
