---

## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in partly paid equity shares of UPL Limited (Scrip Code 890209) effective August 1, 2025, due to the company fixing a record date to identify shareholders eligible for the second and final call notice.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies only to partly paid equity shares (Scrip Code 890209)
- Record date fixed as August 1, 2025
- Second and final call money of Rs. 180 per partly paid share (Re. 1 face value + Rs. 179 premium)
- Trading members advised not to deal in these shares from August 1, 2025
- Settlement number: DR-686/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

- Trading members required to take note of the suspension

## Important Dates

- **August 1, 2025**: Record date and no dealings commencement date
