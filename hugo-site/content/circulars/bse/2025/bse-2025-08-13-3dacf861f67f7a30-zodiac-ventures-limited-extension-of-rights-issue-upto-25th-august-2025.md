title: Zodiac Ventures Limited - Rights Issue Extension to August 25, 2025
---

## Summary

Zodiac Ventures Limited (Scrip Code: 503641) has extended the closing date of its rights issue from August 14, 2025 to August 25, 2025. The Rights Issue Committee made this decision to provide shareholders additional opportunity to exercise their rights. The issue originally opened on July 31, 2025.

## Key Points

- Rights Issue Committee meeting held on August 13, 2025 (2:00 PM to 2:20 PM)
- Issue closing date extended by 11 days from August 14 to August 25, 2025
- Extension aims to provide more time for shareholders to exercise rights
- Last date for Common Application Form (CAF) submission is August 25, 2025
- No changes to Letter of Offer, Abridged LOF, and CAF except closing date

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an administrative extension of the rights issue timeline.

## Compliance Requirements

- Equity shareholders entitled to the rights issue must submit duly filled Common Application Form (CAF) along with application amount by August 25, 2025
- Shareholders should note the revised issue closure date

## Important Dates

**Revised Issue Schedule:**
- Issue Opening Date: July 31, 2025 (Thursday)
- Last date for on-market renunciation: August 8, 2025 (Friday)
- Issue Closing Date: August 25, 2025 (Monday) - **EXTENDED**
- Basis of allotment finalization: September 1, 2025 (Monday)
- Date of Allotment: September 3, 2025 (Wednesday)
- Date of credit: September 6, 2025 (Saturday)
- Date of listing: September 8, 2025 (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

The extension provides shareholders with additional time to participate in the rights issue, potentially improving subscription levels. The 11-day extension shifts the entire post-issue timeline forward, with allotment now expected in early September instead of late August. This administrative change should have minimal market impact but may be positive for shareholder participation rates.
