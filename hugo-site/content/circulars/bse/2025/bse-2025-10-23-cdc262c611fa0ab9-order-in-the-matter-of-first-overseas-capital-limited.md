## Summary

SEBI has issued an order against First Overseas Capital Limited (Registration No. INM000003671), a registered Merchant Banker, following inspections conducted in 2022 and 2024. The company was found in violation of multiple regulatory requirements including failure to maintain minimum net worth of ₹5 Crore, engaging in unauthorized business activities, undertaking excessive underwriting obligations, accepting public deposits, and submitting false information to SEBI. An interim order dated October 23, 2024 had debarred the entity from taking new mandates, which was partially stayed by the Securities Appellate Tribunal on December 11, 2024, subject to the company bringing in ₹3 Crores within 15 days to meet capital adequacy requirements.

## Key Points

- First Overseas Capital Limited violated SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992

- Key Managerial Personnel lacked required certifications
- Incomplete track record disclosure on company website
- SAT partially stayed debarment order, allowing business continuation subject to ₹3 Crore capital infusion within 15 days

## Regulatory Changes

- Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11B(1) and 11B(2) of the SEBI Act, 1992
- Regulation 7 and Regulation 9A(1)(d) of SEBI (Merchant Bankers) Regulations, 1992

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited direct market impact as this affects a single merchant banking entity. However, it reinforces SEBI's strict enforcement stance on capital adequacy and compliance requirements for intermediaries.

**Operational Impact:** 
- First Overseas Capital Limited's ability to take new issue management mandates was restricted by the interim order
- Partial relief granted by SAT allows continued operations subject to capital infusion
- Ongoing clients of the merchant banker may face uncertainty regarding service continuity

**Regulatory Significance:**
- Demonstrates SEBI's zero-tolerance approach to net worth violations and false reporting
- Sends strong message to all registered intermediaries about importance of maintaining regulatory capital requirements
- Highlights consequences of engaging in unauthorized business activities and accepting public deposits
- Emphasizes need for accurate and timely disclosures to the regulator

**Industry Implications:**
- Other merchant bankers should review their net worth compliance and business activities
- Need for robust internal controls to ensure adherence to underwriting limits
- Importance of KMP certifications and disclosure requirements
