## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective September 4, 2025. Nine securities are being added to the ST-ASM framework, one security is moving to a higher stage, and eight securities are moving out of the framework.

## Key Points

- 1 security (Pacheli Industrial Finance Ltd) moving to higher stage ASM
- 8 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework
- Changes effective from September 4, 2025
- Framework includes both main board and SME securities

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures with 5/15/30 day monitoring periods for securities showing abnormal price movements or trading patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ST-ASM trading restrictions
- Enhanced due diligence required for affected securities
- Position limits and other surveillance measures applicable

## Important Dates

SME securities like BLT Logistics, Cryogenic Ogs, and Sahara Maritime are subject to additional scrutiny. Some securities are transitioning to other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM) indicating continued regulatory oversight.
