## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - This is a significant takeover offer affecting public shareholders of Sri Adhikari Brothers Television Network Limited. The acquisition of 13.24% stake represents a substantial ownership change that could impact stock price, trading volumes, and shareholder structure.

**Shareholder Impact:** High - Public shareholders must evaluate the offer terms and decide whether to tender their shares. This represents an exit opportunity at the offer price versus continuing as minority shareholders post-acquisition.

**Corporate Governance Impact:** The acquisition will alter the company's shareholding pattern and potentially influence management control and corporate strategy going forward.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - While the immediate operational impact may be limited, the change in ownership structure could lead to strategic changes in the company's business operations, management, and future direction depending on the acquirer's intentions.
