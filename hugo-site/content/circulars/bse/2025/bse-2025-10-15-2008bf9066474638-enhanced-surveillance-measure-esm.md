title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework Updates - October 16, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective October 16, 2025. Three securities are being newly added to the ESM framework: Raj Packaging Industries Ltd, Titan Intech Ltd, and We Win Ltd. Additionally, two securities currently under ESM will be moved to higher surveillance stages: Magnus Steel and Infra Ltd and Mahaveer Infoway Ltd. The circular also includes a consolidated list of 27+ securities currently under various ESM stages. No securities are being removed from the ESM framework or moved to lower stages.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities shortlisted for ESM framework starting October 16, 2025
- 2 existing ESM securities moving to higher surveillance stages
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages
- No securities exiting the ESM framework
- Consolidated list shows 27+ securities across ESM Stage I and Stage II
- We Win Ltd marked with asterisk indicating NSE alignment

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework is a surveillance mechanism used by BSE to monitor securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or other concerning trading patterns. Securities under ESM are subject to additional restrictions including:

- Trade-for-Trade (T4T) settlement
- 100% upfront margin requirements
- No intraday trading allowed
- Additional disclosure requirements

Progressive stages (Stage I, II, etc.) indicate escalating levels of surveillance with increasingly stringent restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Ensure compliance with T4T settlement for listed securities
- Collect 100% upfront margins from clients before order placement
- Update risk management systems for affected securities
- Inform clients about ESM applicability on their holdings

**For Investors:**
- No intraday trading permitted in ESM securities
- Full payment required before purchase
- Delivery mandatory for all transactions
- Enhanced due diligence recommended before trading

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 16, 2025 - ESM changes become applicable
- **Circular Date:** October 15, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Reduced liquidity in affected securities due to T4T restrictions
- Potential price volatility during transition period
- Limited participation from intraday traders

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must update surveillance lists and margin requirements
- Investors holding these securities face reduced trading flexibility
- Higher capital requirements for taking positions

**Affected Securities Details:**

**Newly Added to ESM (Stage I):**
1. Raj Packaging Industries Ltd (530111, INE639C01013)
2. Titan Intech Ltd (521005, INE807M01031)
3. We Win Ltd (543535, INE082W01014)

**Moving to Higher ESM Stage:**
1. Magnus Steel and Infra Ltd (517320, INE898E01011)
2. Mahaveer Infoway Ltd (539383, INE019D01016)

The ESM framework serves as a protective mechanism for investors by flagging securities with unusual activity patterns, but it also restricts trading flexibility and may impact market depth for the affected securities.
