## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Rs. 30,000 crore total auction size represents routine government borrowing program. The longer-dated 7.09% GS 2074 (50-year security) may attract interest from long-term institutional investors.

**Operational Impact:** Low - Established non-competitive bidding process with clear timelines and contact points for support. Three-day settlement cycle (T+3) from auction to settlement date.

**Participant Impact:** Accessible to both trading members and retail investors through direct participation, with conservative maximum limit of Rs. 2 crore ensuring broad participation opportunity.
