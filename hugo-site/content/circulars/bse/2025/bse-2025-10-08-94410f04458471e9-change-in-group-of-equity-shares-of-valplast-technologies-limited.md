## Summary

BSE has announced that equity shares of VALPLAST TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544565) will be transferred from the Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) to Rolling segment (M Group) effective October 24, 2025. This follows the company's SME IPO listing and represents a transition to normal trading operations.

## Key Points

- Stock transitioning from MT Group (Trade for Trade) to M Group (Rolling segment)
- Scrip Code: 544565
- Company listed on SME platform
- Previous notice referenced: 20251007-55 dated October 7, 2025
- Contact: Mr. Anurag Jain (Tel: 022-2272 8822) for further details

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism will change from Trade for Trade settlement (where each trade settles individually) to Rolling settlement (standard T+2 settlement cycle). This is a standard progression for SME IPO stocks after initial trading stabilization.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the group change
- All trades from October 24, 2025 onwards will follow rolling settlement norms
- Trading members should contact the specified BSE official for clarification if needed

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 8, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 24, 2025 (Friday)
- **Previous Notice**: October 7, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The transition from T2T to rolling settlement typically increases liquidity and trading flexibility. Investors will be able to engage in intraday trading and carry forward positions, unlike the restrictive T2T segment where compulsory delivery applies.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to adjust risk management and settlement processes. The stock will have improved liquidity characteristics and reduced trading restrictions, potentially attracting more retail and institutional participation.
