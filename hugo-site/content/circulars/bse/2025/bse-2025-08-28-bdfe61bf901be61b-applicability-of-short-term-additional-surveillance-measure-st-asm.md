## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective August 29, 2025. The circular adds 4 new securities to the ST-ASM framework and removes 9 securities from it. The ST-ASM framework imposes additional margin requirements and trading restrictions on volatile securities.

- No securities moving between different ASM stages
- Changes effective from August 29, 2025
- Framework includes SME scrips and T+0 scrips based on parent company classification

## Securities Added to ST-ASM (Stage I)

1. ADC India Communications Ltd (523411)
2. Affordable Robotic & Automation Ltd (541402) - As per NSE
3. Lactose India Ltd (524202)
4. Raghuvansh Agrofarms Ltd (538921) - SME scrip

## Securities Removed from ST-ASM

9. Yash Innoventures Ltd (523650) - Moving to ESM framework

## Regulatory Changes

Securities under ST-ASM framework are subject to:
- Enhanced margin requirements
- Trading restrictions during volatile periods
- Additional surveillance measures for 5/15/30 day periods
- Special monitoring for price movements

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must ensure compliance with enhanced margin requirements for listed securities
- Brokers need to update their systems for the new surveillance classifications
- Trading members should inform clients about the surveillance status of affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 29, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 4 securities to ST-ASM may result in reduced trading volumes and increased margin requirements for these stocks. The removal of 9 securities from the framework may lead to normalized trading conditions. Securities moving to ESM framework face stricter surveillance measures.
