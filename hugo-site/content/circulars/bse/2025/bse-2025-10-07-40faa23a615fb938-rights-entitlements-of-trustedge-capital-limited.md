## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must inform all clients about commencement of trading in REs, mentioning the ISIN and clarifying these are not ordinary shares
- Trading Members must include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases stating:
  - Purchase of REs only grants right to participate in Rights Issue or renounce REs before issue closes
  - REs not subscribed or renounced by Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished
- All trading must be conducted in dematerialized form

## Important Dates

- **October 07, 2025**: Notice date
- **October 09, 2025**: Trading in REs commences; Rights Issue opens
- **October 09-13, 2025**: Trading period for renunciation of REs
- **October 16, 2025**: Rights Issue closes; deadline for subscription or renunciation

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to shareholders of TRUSTEDGE CAPITAL LIMITED. The short 5-day trading window (Oct 9-13) for renunciation requires prompt action from investors wishing to trade their rights.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure systems are configured for T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade mechanism. Client communication and contract note disclaimers must be implemented before trading commences.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders receive rights entitlements and must decide within the trading window whether to subscribe, renounce (sell), or allow REs to lapse. Unexercised REs will be extinguished after October 16, 2025, representing potential loss of value.
