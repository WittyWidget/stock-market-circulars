## Summary

- Record date set for July 30, 2025
- Purpose: Redemption of bonds and payment of interest
- No dealings allowed from July 30, 2025
- Notice reference: DR-684/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified bonds from July 30, 2025

- Compliance with corporate action processing requirements

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: July 30, 2025
