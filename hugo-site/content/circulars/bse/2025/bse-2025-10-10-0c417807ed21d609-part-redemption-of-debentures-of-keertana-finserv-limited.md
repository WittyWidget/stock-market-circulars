## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to a specific debt instrument of a private company.

Trading members dealing with these specific NCDs need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face value from the effective date. The announcement provides sufficient advance notice (5 days) for operational adjustments.
