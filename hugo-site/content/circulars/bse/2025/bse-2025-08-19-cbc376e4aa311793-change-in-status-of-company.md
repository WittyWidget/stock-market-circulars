## Summary

BSE has announced that the delisting of Bhagawati Gas Ltd (Scrip Code: 500051) has been rescinded pursuant to an order from the Hon'ble Supreme Court. The company's status will change from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective August 21, 2025.

## Key Points

- Bhagawati Gas Ltd delisting has been rescinded by Supreme Court order
- Company status changes from "Delisted" to "Suspended"
- SEBI Delisting Regulations provisions no longer applicable to the company
- Change affects scrip code 500051

## Regulatory Changes

The provisions of Regulation 24(1) and Regulation 24(2) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 are no longer applicable to Bhagawati Gas Ltd following the Supreme Court order.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed of the status change and should adjust their systems accordingly to reflect the new "Suspended" status instead of "Delisted".

## Important Dates

- **August 21, 2025**: Effective date for status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"
- **August 19, 2025**: Notice date

## Impact Assessment

The status change from delisted to suspended means the company returns to BSE's oversight but remains non-tradeable. This provides a pathway for potential future restoration of trading privileges subject to compliance requirements.
