## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of government securities that expands available debt instruments for trading. Treasury Bills provide short-term investment options for market participants seeking sovereign-backed securities.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Trading members need to update their systems with the new scrip codes and symbols. The pre-maturity trading restriction is standard practice for debt securities and requires no new operational procedures.

**Liquidity Impact**: Neutral to slightly positive, as additional government securities provide more options for debt market participants, particularly those seeking short-term sovereign instruments across different maturity tenors.
