## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine debt security listing that affects only the BSE debt segment. The addition of high-quality AAA-rated securities provides more investment options for debt market participants but has no direct impact on equity markets or broader market operations.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for debt investors seeking AAA-rated corporate bonds with varying maturities (3, 5, and 15 years) and competitive interest rates (7.07% to 7.45%). The securities offer diversification across different maturity profiles.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Standard listing procedures apply with dematerialized trading requirements already in place for debt securities on BSE.
