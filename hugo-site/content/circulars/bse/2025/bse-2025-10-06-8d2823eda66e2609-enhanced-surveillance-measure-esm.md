- Enhanced monitoring of corporate announcements and material events
- Compliance with stricter reporting standards

**For Brokers and Traders:**
- Adhere to revised margin requirements for ESM securities
- Inform clients about ESM status and associated trading restrictions
- Monitor trading activity in ESM securities more closely

**For Investors:**
- Awareness of reduced liquidity due to periodic call auctions
- Higher capital requirements due to increased margins
- Limited trading windows compared to normal securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 7, 2025 - All ESM changes come into effect
- **Circular Date:** October 6, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Reduced liquidity for 10 newly added securities due to surveillance restrictions
- Potential price discovery challenges with call auction mechanisms
- Increased volatility concerns addressed through tighter price bands

**Investor Impact:**
- Higher margin requirements will increase capital costs for positions in ESM securities
- Limited trading opportunities with periodic auction sessions
- Potential difficulty in entry/exit from positions

**Company Impact:**
- Reputational concerns for companies placed under enhanced surveillance
