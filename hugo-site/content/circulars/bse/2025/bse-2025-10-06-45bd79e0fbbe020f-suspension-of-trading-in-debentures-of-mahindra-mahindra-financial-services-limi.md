---

## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in non-convertible debentures of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Limited (ISIN: INE774D08LO9, Code: 952914) effective October 10, 2025. The suspension is implemented due to the company setting a record date of October 12, 2025 for redemption of debentures and payment of interest on the 8.90% debenture series maturing October 27, 2025.

## Key Points

- Trading suspended for MMFSL 8.90%-27-10-25-PVT debentures (ISIN: INE774D08LO9)
- BSE scrip code: 952914
- No dealings permitted from October 10, 2025
- Record date set for October 12, 2025
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Debenture maturity date: October 27, 2025
- Notice reference: DR-733/2025-2026
- Issued by: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President â€“ Listing Operations (CRD)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action procedure for debenture redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified debentures from October 10, 2025
- Trading members are required to note and comply with the trading suspension
- Investors must ensure their holdings are recorded by the record date to be eligible for redemption proceeds and interest payment

## Important Dates

- **October 6, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 10, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date (no dealings from this date)
- **October 12, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **October 27, 2025**: Debenture maturity date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. The suspension affects only holders of this specific NCD series. The suspension is temporary and procedural in nature, related to the scheduled maturity and redemption process.

**Investor Impact**: Medium for debenture holders. Investors holding these debentures will receive redemption proceeds and final interest payment. Trading liquidity is eliminated from October 10, 2025, so holders who wish to exit should have done so before this date.

**Operational Impact**: Routine corporate action with no broader market implications beyond the specific security.
