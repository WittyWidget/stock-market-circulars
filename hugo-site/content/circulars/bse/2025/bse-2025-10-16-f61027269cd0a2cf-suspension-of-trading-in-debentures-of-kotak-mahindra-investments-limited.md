title: Suspension of Trading in Debentures of Kotak Mahindra Investments Limited
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in specific non-convertible debentures of Kotak Mahindra Investments Limited effective October 20, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing the record date for redemption of its 8% debentures (ISIN: INE975F07HU4, Code: 974317). Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the no-dealings date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspended for KMIL 8% debentures maturing November 4, 2025
- ISIN: INE975F07HU4 (BSE Code: 974317)
- Record date for redemption: October 20, 2025
- No dealings permitted from: October 20, 2025
- Notice reference: DR-739/2025-2026
- Issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President â€“ Listing Operations (CRD)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for debenture redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from October 20, 2025
- Trading members must ensure compliance with the no-dealings directive
- Members should update their systems to reflect the trading suspension

## Important Dates

- **October 16, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 20, 2025**: Record date for redemption
- **October 20, 2025**: No dealings effective date (trading suspension begins)
- **November 4, 2025**: Debenture maturity date (implied from security name)

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of this specific debenture series. This is a routine corporate action related to scheduled debt redemption. Debenture holders as of the record date will receive redemption proceeds. The suspension ensures orderly settlement and prevents trading in securities that are being redeemed. No broader market impact is expected as this affects only a single privately placed debt instrument series.
