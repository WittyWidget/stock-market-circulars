Halder Venture Limited clarified price movement, noting a 2:1 bonus share issue with record date September 2, 2025.

- Both companies confirmed compliance with SEBI Listing Regulations
- Companies stated no pending material information requiring disclosure
- Halder Venture issued 82,92,090 bonus equity shares of â‚¹10 each

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. Companies responded under existing Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

- Proper disclosure and compliance for corporate actions like bonus issues

## Important Dates
