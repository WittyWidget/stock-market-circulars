This change provides greater flexibility in compliance while maintaining investor protection.

## Key Points

- Deposits must still be marked as lien in favour of IAASB or RAASB
- Amendment regulations were notified on August 6-7, 2025
- Compliance deadline set for September 30, 2025
- BSE Limited (as IAASB/RAASB) must implement necessary systems and procedures

## Regulatory Changes

- SEBI (Investment Advisers) (Amendment) Regulations, 2025 notified on August 7, 2025

  - Units of liquid mutual fund
  - Units of overnight mutual fund
  - Traditional bank deposit with scheduled bank
- All deposits must be marked as lien in favour of appropriate supervisory body
- BSE Limited must establish systems for implementation and notify affected parties

## Important Dates
