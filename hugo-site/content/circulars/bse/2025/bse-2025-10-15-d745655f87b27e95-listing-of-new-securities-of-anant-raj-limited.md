Trading members should note the increased share count when analyzing market capitalization and liquidity metrics.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal operational impact on trading members. The new shares are immediately tradable and fungible with existing shares. The substantial number of new shares may increase trading volumes and liquidity in the scrip.
