  2025 Update
---

## Summary

BSE has updated its surveillance framework for companies with high promoter and non-promoter encumbrance as per SEBI (SAST) Regulation 28(3), effective August 1, 2025. No new securities were added to the framework, while four companies moved out of the restrictive measures.

## Key Points

- No new securities added to the high encumbrance surveillance framework
- Four companies successfully moved out of the framework: B. L. Kashyap and Sons Ltd, Forbes & Company Ltd, Forbes Precision Tools and Mac, and Tourism Finance Corporation of India Ltd
- Consolidated list now contains 5 securities under surveillance
- Framework monitors companies with high promoter and non-promoter pledge levels

## Regulatory Changes

- Updated surveillance list effective August 1, 2025
- Framework continues to operate under SEBI (SAST) Regulation 28(3)
- Securities may exit framework due to inclusion in other surveillance measures (LT ASM or ESM)

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must maintain compliance with SEBI (SAST) regulations regarding promoter and non-promoter encumbrance
- Companies under surveillance subject to additional monitoring and reporting requirements
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance status when trading these securities

## Important Dates

- **August 1, 2025**: Effective date for updated surveillance framework
- **July 31, 2025**: Circular publication date

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Development**: Four companies successfully moved out of the restrictive surveillance framework, indicating improved compliance with encumbrance regulations. The consolidated list reduction from previous levels to just 5 securities suggests overall improvement in promoter pledge management across listed companies. This framework helps protect investor interests by monitoring companies with high encumbrance levels that could pose governance risks.
