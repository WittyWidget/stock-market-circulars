  movement explanations

## Summary

BSE received clarifications from two companies regarding recent price movements in their shares. Pecos Hotels and Pubs Limited attributed price movement to branch relocation and consistent dividend payments, while Yash Chemex Limited stated they are unaware of specific reasons and believe movement is market-driven.

## Key Points

- Pecos Hotels shifted Koramangala branch to strategic Brigade Road location in Bangalore
- Pecos expects incremental revenue from new location in current fiscal year
- Pecos has paid final dividends for three consecutive years (FY 2022-23, 2023-24, 2024-25)
- Yash Chemex confirms compliance with SEBI LODR regulations
- Both companies state no material undisclosed information pending
- Price movements attributed to market conditions rather than specific corporate actions

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced.

## Compliance Requirements

Both companies reaffirm adherence to Regulation 30 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015 for timely disclosure of material information.

## Important Dates

- August 28, 2025: Date of clarifications
- April 10, 2025: Pecos previously disclosed branch relocation information

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as clarifications contain no material new information. Routine surveillance responses that provide transparency on recent price volatility without indicating fundamental business changes.
