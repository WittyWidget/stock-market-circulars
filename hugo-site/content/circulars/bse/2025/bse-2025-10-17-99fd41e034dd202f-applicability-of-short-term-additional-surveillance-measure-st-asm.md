title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective October 20, 2025. Ten securities have been newly shortlisted into the ST-ASM framework, while 14 securities are moving out. No securities are moving to higher or lower stages within the framework. The circular includes consolidated lists of all securities under surveillance.

## Key Points

- 10 securities newly shortlisted for Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework from October 20, 2025
- 14 securities moving out of the ST-ASM Framework
- New entries include Aptus Pharma Ltd, Bits Ltd, Earkart Ltd, Envair Electrodyne Ltd, Global Vectra Helicorp Ltd, Lyons Corporate Market Ltd, Onix Solar Energy Ltd, Rachit Prints Ltd, Solvex Edibles Ltd, and Twamev Construction And Infrastructure Ltd
- Securities marked @ are SME scrips
- Securities marked ~ are T+0 scrips shortlisted as per parent company
- No securities moving to higher or lower stages within ST-ASM

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework applies additional surveillance measures to securities exhibiting price volatility or unusual trading patterns. Securities under this framework face enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions based on their stage (5/15/30 days). The framework is designed to protect investor interests and maintain market integrity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the revised list of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Trading members should implement appropriate risk management measures for affected securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in ST-ASM securities
- Comply with applicable margin and position limit requirements for these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 20, 2025 - Changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Securities Moving In**: The 10 newly shortlisted securities will face enhanced surveillance, which may result in reduced liquidity, higher margins, and increased scrutiny of trading activity. This typically affects short-term trading strategies and may deter speculative activity.

**Securities Moving Out**: 14 securities are exiting ST-ASM due to various reasons:
- 1 security moving to LT-ASM (Long Term ASM) framework
- 2 securities moving to Trade for Trade framework
- 11 securities graduating out of surveillance measures

The exits indicate improved price stability or completion of surveillance period for most securities, though some face more stringent measures under different frameworks. Overall market impact is moderate, affecting liquidity and trading behavior in these specific counters.
