## Summary

BSE has implemented new phone numbers in the 1600 series for making outbound calls to members regarding technical queries. This change is in compliance with TRAI's amended Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018, which aims to strengthen consumer protection against Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC). Members will now receive outbound calls from 1600313680/1600113188 with immediate effect.

## Key Points

- New outbound call numbers: 1600313680 and 1600113188
- Change implemented with immediate effect from October 27, 2025
- Compliance with TRAI's amended TCCCPR, 2018 regulations
- BSE Technical Helpdesk contact numbers remain unchanged: 022-45720400/600 and 022-69158500
- Technical support email remains: bsehelp@bseindia.com
- Support hours: 8:00 AM to 7:30 PM on business days

## Regulatory Changes

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has amended the Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations (TCCCPR), 2018 to strengthen consumer protection against Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC). As per these amendments, BSE is required to use the 1600 series for making outbound calls to members.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members should update their contact records to recognize calls from 1600313680 and 1600113188 as legitimate BSE technical support calls
- Members should ensure these numbers are not blocked or marked as spam in their phone systems
- No action required from members beyond awareness of the new calling numbers

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 27, 2025 (immediate effect)
- Notice Date: October 27, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. This is purely an administrative change affecting the phone numbers from which BSE makes outbound calls for technical queries. The existing helpdesk numbers that members use to call BSE remain unchanged.

**Member Impact**: Low. Members only need to be aware that technical support calls will now come from the new 1600 series numbers. All other contact mechanisms (inbound helpdesk numbers and email) remain the same.

**Trading Impact**: None. This change does not affect any trading systems, connectivity, or market operations.
