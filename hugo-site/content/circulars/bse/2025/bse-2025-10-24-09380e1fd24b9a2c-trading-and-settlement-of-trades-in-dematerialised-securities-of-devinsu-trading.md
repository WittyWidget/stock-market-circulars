  Ltd

## Summary

Devinsu Trading Ltd (scrip code: 512445) has signed agreements with both depositories (NSDL and CDSL). Effective Monday, October 27, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-743/2025-2026), the scrip will undergo significant trading modality changes including migration to Trade to Trade (XT) segment, market lot change from 100 to 1 share, and compulsory demat settlement.

## Key Points

- Scrip will move from Group P to Group XT (Trade to Trade segment)
- Market lot reduced from 100 shares to 1 share
- All trades must be settled in compulsory dematerialised form
- Netting will not be allowed in the scrip
- Shortages will be directly closed-out
- ISIN remains unchanged: INE07LH01016
- Trade to Trade classification is for reasons other than non-signing of depository agreements

## Regulatory Changes

**Group Migration:** The scrip is being moved from Group P to Group XT, placing it in the Trade to Trade segment where each trade must be settled individually without netting.

**Market Lot Revision:** The minimum tradable quantity has been reduced from 100 equity shares to 1 equity share, making the scrip more accessible for smaller investors.

**Settlement Mechanism:** Despite being in Trade to Trade segment for other reasons, the company has now completed depository agreements, enabling compulsory demat settlement.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Execute all trades in market lot of 1 equity share only
- Ensure all settlements are in dematerialised form (no physical certificates)
- Do not attempt netting of trades in this scrip
- Be aware that shortages will result in direct close-out without alternative settlement options

**For Investors:**
- Must hold shares in demat form for trading
- Each buy/sell transaction will be settled individually (no netting)
- Minimum purchase/sale quantity is now 1 share instead of 100 shares

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 24, 2025
- **Effective Date:** Monday, October 27, 2025
- **Settlement Number:** DR-743/2025-2026 onwards

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** The migration to XT group increases trading friction as netting is not permitted, potentially reducing liquidity. However, the reduction in market lot from 100 to 1 share significantly lowers the entry barrier for retail investors.

**Settlement Impact:** Compulsory demat settlement eliminates physical certificate handling, improving settlement efficiency and reducing operational risk. The direct close-out mechanism for shortages increases delivery discipline.

**Investor Impact:** Lower market lot makes the stock more accessible to small investors. Trade to Trade segment typically experiences higher volatility and lower liquidity compared to regular segments. Investors should exercise caution and ensure delivery capability before trading.
