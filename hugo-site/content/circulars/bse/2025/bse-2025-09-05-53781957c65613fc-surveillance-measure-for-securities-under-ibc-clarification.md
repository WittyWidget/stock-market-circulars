title: Surveillance Measure for Securities under IBC - Clarification
---

## Summary

BSE has issued clarification on surveillance measures for securities of companies under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The framework establishes two-stage surveillance system with progressively stricter measures including gross settlement, price bands, margin requirements, and trading restrictions based on price volatility thresholds.

## Key Points

- Two-stage surveillance framework (Stage I and Stage II) for IBC companies
- Separate frameworks for non-derivative securities and securities with derivative products
- Gross settlement + ±5% price band + 100% margin imposed from T+2 day upon IBC announcement
- Once-a-week trading restriction in both stages
- ASD (100% Trade Value) to be deposited by buyers
- Securities move out of surveillance after non-promoter holding reaches ≥25% and completion of 3 calendar months
- Stage II includes "no upward movement permitted" restriction
- For derivative securities: 100% margin levied, no fresh contracts issued, existing surveillance applies after contract expiry

## Regulatory Changes

- Clarification of existing IBC surveillance framework
- Defined criteria for movement between surveillance stages
- Specified exit conditions based on non-promoter shareholding threshold
- Separate treatment for securities with derivative products available

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies under IBC must comply with surveillance measures immediately from T+2 day
- Buyers must deposit 100% trade value as ASD
- Trading members must ensure compliance with once-a-week trading restriction
- Quarterly shareholding pattern reporting or ad-hoc updates required for exit consideration
- No fresh derivative contracts allowed for IBC securities

## Important Dates

- Surveillance measures effective from T+2 day upon IBC announcement
- Monthly review for Stage I to Stage II movement (minimum 1 month in Stage I)
- Monthly review for Stage II to Stage I movement (minimum 1 month in Stage II)
- 3 calendar months completion required after attaining ≥25% non-promoter holding for exit
- Daily basis review for inclusion under IBC Stage I

## Impact Assessment

- Severe trading restrictions will significantly reduce liquidity for IBC securities
- 100% margin requirement will deter speculative trading
- Once-a-week trading severely limits market participation
- No upward movement in Stage II completely restricts price appreciation
- Framework provides clear exit mechanism encouraging resolution of insolvency cases
- Separate derivative treatment prevents circumvention of cash market restrictions
