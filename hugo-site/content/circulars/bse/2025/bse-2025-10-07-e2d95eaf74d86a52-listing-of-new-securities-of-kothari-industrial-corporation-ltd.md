**Liquidity Impact**: Moderate increase in total share base, though majority of new shares (68,20,000) are locked in until April 2027, limiting immediate liquidity impact.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution from preferential allotment. New shares will trade alongside existing shares from October 8, 2025, subject to lock-in restrictions.

**Operational Impact**: Routine listing procedure with no special trading arrangements required beyond standard lock-in enforcement.
