---

## Summary

BSE has announced that Rolex Rings Ltd (Scrip Code: 543325) will sub-divide its equity shares in a ratio of 1:10. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs. 10/- will be sub-divided into ten equity shares with a face value of Re. 1/- each. The record date for this sub-division is October 17, 2025, and the new share structure will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: Rolex Rings Ltd (Scrip Code: 543325)
- Sub-division ratio: 1:10 (one share of Rs. 10/- split into ten shares of Re. 1/-)
- Record date: October 17, 2025
- Effective date: October 17, 2025
- Old ISIN (INE645S01016) for Rs. 10/- shares will become invalid from October 17, 2025
- New ISIN for Re. 1/- shares to be announced separately
- Notice reference: DR-738/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action involving share capital restructuring through sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note that the existing ISIN (INE645S01016) for Rs. 10/- paid-up shares will not be valid for transactions on or after October 17, 2025
- Members must await separate notice for the new ISIN number for Re. 1/- paid-up shares
- All trading and settlement systems should be updated to reflect the new share structure from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 6, 2025
- **Record Date**: October 17, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 17, 2025 (new share structure becomes operational)
- **Old ISIN Invalid From**: October 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**For Shareholders**: The sub-division will increase the number of shares held by existing shareholders tenfold while reducing the face value proportionately. This does not affect the overall shareholding value but improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors.

**For Trading**: Lower face value typically enhances trading liquidity and makes the stock more accessible to small investors. The price per share will adjust proportionately to reflect the 1:10 split.

**Operational Impact**: Demat accounts will be credited with additional shares post-record date. Trading systems will need to recognize the new ISIN and adjusted price bands from the effective date.
