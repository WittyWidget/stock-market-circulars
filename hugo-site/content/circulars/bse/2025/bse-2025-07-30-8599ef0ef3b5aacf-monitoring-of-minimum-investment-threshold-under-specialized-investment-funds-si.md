title: Monitoring of Minimum Investment Threshold under Specialized Investment Funds
  (SIF)
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued detailed guidelines for monitoring minimum investment threshold compliance in Specialized Investment Funds (SIFs). The circular establishes a framework where AMCs must monitor compliance daily and automatically redeem units if investors fail to maintain the INR 10 lakh minimum investment threshold after receiving 30 days notice.

## Key Points

- AMCs must monitor minimum investment threshold compliance on daily basis
- Active breach occurs when aggregate investment falls below INR 10 lakh due to investor-initiated transactions
- Units are frozen for debit upon active breach detection
- 30 calendar days notice period given to investors to rebalance investments
- Automatic redemption at next business day NAV if investor fails to comply within notice period
- Applies to transactions including redemption, transfer, sale on exchanges or off-market transfers

## Regulatory Changes

- Introduction of specific monitoring mechanism for SIF minimum investment threshold
- Definition of 'Active Breach' as fall below INR 10 lakh due to investor-initiated transactions
- Establishment of freeze-notice-redemption process for non-compliance
- Daily monitoring requirement for AMCs

## Compliance Requirements

- **AMCs**: Implement daily monitoring systems, freeze units upon breach, issue 30-day notices, execute automatic redemptions
- **RTAs**: Put in place necessary systems for implementation
- **Depositories**: Establish required systems for compliance monitoring
- **All entities**: Ensure no active breaches of minimum investment threshold

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 29, 2025 (date of circular)
- **Notice Period**: 30 calendar days for investor rebalancing
- **Redemption**: Next immediate business day after 30th calendar day of notice period

## Impact Assessment

This circular provides operational clarity for SIF compliance but may impact investor flexibility. The automatic redemption mechanism protects fund structure integrity while the 30-day notice period provides reasonable time for compliance. AMCs and service providers need to implement new monitoring and execution systems.
