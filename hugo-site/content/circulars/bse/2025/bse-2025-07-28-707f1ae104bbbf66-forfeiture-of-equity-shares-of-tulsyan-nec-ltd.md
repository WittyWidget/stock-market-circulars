## Key Points

- Forfeiture involves both NER 6/- PP (Partly Paid) and NEP 3/- PP (Partly Paid) shares
- Reconciliation data shows various folio numbers, certificate ranges, and share quantities
- Data includes transfer details with certificate numbers and share holdings
- Multiple categories of partly paid shares are affected in the forfeiture process

## Share Categories Affected

**NER 6/- PP Shares:**
- Various folios ranging from 39033 to 39236
- Share quantities ranging from 5 to 36,609 shares
- Certificate numbers and distribution details provided

**NEP 3/- PP Shares:**
- Folios ranging from 39037 to 39262
- Share quantities ranging from 4 to 20,000 shares
- Detailed certificate ranges and transfer information

## Compliance Requirements

- Shareholders holding partly paid shares in the affected folios need to be aware of the forfeiture

- Transfer agents and depositories must update records accordingly

## Important Dates
