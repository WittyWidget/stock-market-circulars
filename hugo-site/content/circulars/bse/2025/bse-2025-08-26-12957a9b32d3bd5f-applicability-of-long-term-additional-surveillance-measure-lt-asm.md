title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has updated the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective August 28, 2025. Seven securities have been newly included in the LT-ASM framework, while one security (OTCO International Ltd) has been moved out due to inclusion in the GSM Framework.

## Key Points

- 7 securities newly shortlisted for Long Term ASM Framework
- 1 security (OTCO International Ltd) moving out of LT-ASM due to GSM Framework inclusion
- No securities moving between different ASM stages
- Consolidated list shows multiple securities across different ASM stages (Stage I primarily)
- Changes effective from August 28, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The LT-ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities that meet specific criteria. Securities under this framework are subject to additional monitoring and potential trading restrictions to protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under LT-ASM framework
- Enhanced due diligence requirements for transactions in these securities
- Compliance with additional surveillance measures as prescribed by the exchange

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 28, 2025 - New LT-ASM classifications take effect

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of 7 additional securities in the LT-ASM framework will subject them to enhanced surveillance measures, potentially affecting their trading volumes and liquidity. The removal of OTCO International Ltd from LT-ASM (due to GSM inclusion) indicates a shift to a different regulatory framework with its own set of compliance requirements.
