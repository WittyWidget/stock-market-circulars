## Impact Assessment

This NFO launch has limited market impact as it is a routine product introduction in the mutual fund segment. It provides investors with a new passive investment option for midcap exposure through the Nifty Midcap 150 index. The impact is confined to BSE StAR MF Platform members and potential investors interested in midcap ETF products. No changes to existing market operations or trading rules are involved.
