## Summary

BSE has announced surveillance measures for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework. AGS Transact Technologies Ltd (Scrip Code: 543451) has been shortlisted for Stage 0 surveillance relating to receipt of corporate announcements/disclosures, effective September 3, 2025. The circular provides a consolidated list of 13 companies currently under various stages of IBC surveillance measures.

## Key Points

- AGS Transact Technologies Ltd moved to Stage 0 surveillance for receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure
- No securities moved to Stage 1 (Additional Surveillance Measure for IRP) or between Stage 1 and Stage 2
- 13 companies currently under IBC surveillance framework in various stages
- Measures effective from September 3, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The surveillance framework categorizes companies into different stages based on their status in the Insolvency Resolution Process:
- Stage 0: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from company
- Stage 1: Additional Surveillance Measure for companies in IRP
- Stage 2: Enhanced surveillance measures

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the surveillance status of AGS Transact Technologies Ltd
- Enhanced monitoring requirements apply for securities under IBC framework
- Market participants should be aware of the surveillance stage for affected securities

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: September 3, 2025
- Announcement Date: September 2, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The surveillance measures ensure proper monitoring of securities undergoing insolvency proceedings. While AGS Transact Technologies enters Stage 0 surveillance, the overall market impact is limited as this primarily affects monitoring and disclosure requirements rather than trading restrictions. The consolidated list shows 13 companies under various stages of IBC surveillance, indicating ongoing monitoring of distressed securities.
