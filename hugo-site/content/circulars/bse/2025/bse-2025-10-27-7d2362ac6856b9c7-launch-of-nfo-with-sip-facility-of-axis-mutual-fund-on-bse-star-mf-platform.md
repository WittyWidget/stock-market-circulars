## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine NFO launch that expands investment product offerings on the BSE StAR MF Platform. The debt-category fund-of-funds provides investors with additional allocation options in the arbitrage passive strategy segment.

**Operational Impact**: Low to moderate for BSE members and distributors. Members need to communicate NFO timelines and fund payment deadlines to clients. The extended trading hours for lumpsum purchases (till 6:00 PM) and specific SIP registration deadlines require operational awareness and client communication.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors seeking debt-oriented arbitrage strategies through a fund-of-funds structure. The availability of both Regular and Direct plans with multiple payout options provides flexibility in investment choices.
