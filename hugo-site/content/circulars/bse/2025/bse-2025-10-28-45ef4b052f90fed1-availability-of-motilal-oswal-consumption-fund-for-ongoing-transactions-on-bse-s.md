## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market-wide impact as it pertains to a single mutual fund scheme's operational status. The reopening benefits investors who wish to invest in or redeem from the MOTILAL OSWAL CONSUMPTION FUND, an equity-focused consumption theme fund. The availability of systematic transaction facilities (SIP/STP/SWP) provides flexibility for regular investors. No broader market implications or compliance burden on market participants beyond normal mutual fund transaction processing.
