## Summary

BSE has issued a notice for suspension of trading in securities of Ramasigns Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 515127) effective November 14, 2025, due to non-compliance with Regulation 31 (Shareholding Pattern disclosure) of SEBI LODR Regulations 2015 for two consecutive quarters (March 2025 and June 2025). The suspension can be avoided if the company complies by November 11, 2025. Additionally, all promoter shareholdings will be frozen during the suspension period.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension will commence on November 14, 2025 (30 days from notice date)

- Entire promoter shareholding and all securities in promoter demat accounts will be frozen during suspension
- Suspension can be avoided if company complies by November 11, 2025
- After suspension, if non-compliance continues, trade-for-trade in Z group will be allowed only on first trading day of each week for six months (starting 15 days after suspension)
- Notice issued pursuant to SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This notice enforces existing penal provisions under SEBI Master Circular dated November 11, 2024 regarding the Standard Operating Procedure for suspension and revocation of trading for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates

- **October 14, 2025**: Notice issued
- **November 11, 2025**: Last date for company to comply and avoid suspension
- **November 14, 2025**: Trading suspension becomes effective (if non-compliant)
- **November 29, 2025 onwards**: Trade-for-trade basis on first trading day of every week for 6 months (15 days after suspension, if applicable)

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Company and Shareholders:**
- Complete trading suspension prevents all buy/sell transactions affecting liquidity
- Promoter holdings frozen, preventing any sale or pledge of shares
- After 15 days of suspension, severely restricted trading (once per week, trade-for-trade only)
- Z group classification indicates highest risk category
- Negative market perception and potential price impact
- Shareholders unable to exit positions during suspension period
- Company faces reputational damage and potential delisting risk if non-compliance continues

**Broader Market Impact:**
- Low broader market impact as Ramasigns Industries is a single small-cap company
- Reinforces SEBI's strict enforcement of disclosure requirements
- Serves as warning to other non-compliant listed entities
