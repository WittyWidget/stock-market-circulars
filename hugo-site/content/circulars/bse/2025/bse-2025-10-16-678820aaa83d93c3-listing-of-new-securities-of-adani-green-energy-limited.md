These shares were issued at a premium to promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to the conversion of warrants. The shares carry a lock-in period until April 19, 2027.

## Key Points

- 18,84,671 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each listed
- Issue price: Rs. 1,480.75 per share (including premium of Rs. 1,470.75)
- Issued to promoters on preferential basis through warrant conversion
- Trading permitted from Friday, October 17, 2025

- Date of Allotment: May 20, 2025
- ISIN: INE364U01010
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for new securities issued pursuant to warrant conversion under existing SEBI regulations for preferential allotment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new securities available for trading from October 17, 2025
- All newly listed shares are subject to lock-in restrictions until April 19, 2027
- Market participants should update their records with the new distinctive number range

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: May 20, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: October 17, 2025 (Friday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: April 19, 2027

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing adds 18.84 lakh shares to Adani Green Energy's outstanding equity base. However, immediate market impact is limited as all shares are locked-in for approximately 18 months until April 2027, preventing any trading or transfer during this period.

**Promoter Holdings**: The preferential allotment to promoters will increase promoter shareholding percentage, strengthening their control over the company.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact on stock liquidity since locked-in shares cannot be traded. Post lock-in expiry in 2027, the additional shares may marginally increase float.

**Financial Impact**: The allotment at Rs. 1,480.75 per share raised approximately Rs. 279.02 crores for the company, supporting its capital requirements for renewable energy projects.
