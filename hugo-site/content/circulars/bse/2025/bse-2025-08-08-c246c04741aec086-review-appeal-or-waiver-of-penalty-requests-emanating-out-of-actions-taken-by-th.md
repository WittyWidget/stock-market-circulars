## Summary

SEBI has modified the Terms of Reference for Member Committees of Market Infrastructure Institutions (MIIs) regarding the handling of review, appeal or waiver of penalty requests. The circular establishes a new two-tier system where appeals against Internal Committee actions go to Member Committee, while appeals against Member Committee actions will be handled by a separate mechanism with Public Interest Directors.

## Key Points

- Requests for review/appeal/waiver against Internal Committee actions or pre-approved policy actions will be placed before Member Committee
- Appeals against Member Committee actions will be handled by a mechanism with Public Interest Directors and/or Independent External Professionals
- Governing Board must issue Standard Operating Procedure for handling appeals against Member Committee decisions
- Further appeals can be made to appropriate authority based on applicable laws
- Applies to all Stock Exchanges, Clearing Corporations, and Depositories

## Regulatory Changes

- Modified Terms of Reference for Member Committees on regulatory actions
- Established two-tier appeal mechanism separating appeals against Internal Committee vs Member Committee actions
- Required Governing Boards to setup independent appeal mechanism for Member Committee decisions
- Mandated creation of Standard Operating Procedures for new appeal process

## Compliance Requirements

- MIIs must put in place necessary systems for implementation
- Make necessary amendments to byelaws, rules and regulations
- Bring provisions to notice of market participants and investors
- Disseminate circular on their websites
- Setup appeal mechanism with Public Interest Directors/Independent External Professionals
- Issue Standard Operating Procedures for handling appeals

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: 45th day from August 5, 2025 (September 19, 2025)
- **Circular Date**: August 5, 2025
- **BSE Publication**: August 8, 2025
