## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of new securities effective October 14, 2025
- Lock-in restrictions apply to all 4.5 crore shares until April 15, 2027
- Shares cannot be transferred or sold by promoters during the lock-in period

## Important Dates

- **September 17, 2025**: First tranche allotment (2.25 crore shares)
- **September 22, 2025**: Second tranche allotment (2.25 crore shares)
- **October 14, 2025**: Trading commencement date
- **April 15, 2027**: Lock-in expiry date for all shares

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The listing adds 4.5 crore shares to the total equity base of Dhani Services Limited, representing potential dilution for existing shareholders. However, the immediate market impact is mitigated as all shares are allotted to promoters with a lock-in period until April 2027.

**Liquidity Impact**: Low to medium. While the shares increase the company's equity capital, they will not contribute to free float or tradable volumes until the lock-in expires in April 2027.

**Promoter Impact**: Positive for promoters who have converted warrants to equity at Rs. 90.30 per share, increasing their stake in the company.

**Investor Consideration**: Investors should factor in the expanded equity base when evaluating per-share metrics. The lock-in provides stability by preventing immediate selling pressure from the new issuance.
