## Summary

The Security Council Committee pursuant to resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253 (2015) has amended two entries on its ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions List on October 6, 2025. These amendments update the sanctions list of individuals subject to assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo under paragraph 1 of Security Council Resolution 2734 (2024), adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Market participants must ensure compliance with Section 51A of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.

## Key Points

- Two individual entries amended on UN Security Council ISIL and Al-Qaida Sanctions List effective October 6, 2025
- Abd El Kader Mahmoud Mohamed El Sayed (QDi.065): Egyptian national, DOB December 26, 1962, Italian Fiscal Code SSYBLK62T26Z336L, sentenced to 8 years in Italy (February 2, 2004), reportedly killed in Afghanistan-Pakistan border region in 2012
- Aris Sumarsono (QDi.187): Indonesian national, DOB April 19, 1963, also known as Zulkarnan/Zulkarnain, sentenced to 15 years in prison in Indonesia (January 2022)
- Sanctions include assets freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo under UNSC Resolution 2734 (2024)
- Updates enacted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter
- Market participants must screen against updated sanctions list

## Regulatory Changes

The amendments reflect updates to the consolidated UNSC sanctions list maintained under resolutions 1267 (1999), 1989 (2011), 2253 (2015), 2368 (2017), 2610 (2021), and 2734 (2024). The changes include updated information on listed individuals including aliases, addresses, and current status. These updates are made regularly based on information provided by Member States and international/regional organizations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must screen all transactions and accounts against the updated ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions List
- Implement enhanced due diligence for any matches or potential matches with listed individuals
- Freeze assets and prevent financial transactions involving the listed individuals or their known aliases
- Report any suspicious transactions or potential matches to appropriate authorities
- Update internal sanctions screening systems with the amended entries
- Ensure compliance with Section 51A of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967
- Review existing customer databases against updated list entries
- Maintain records of sanctions screening activities

## Important Dates

- **October 6, 2025**: Amendments to sanctions list enacted by Security Council Committee
- **October 9, 2025**: BSE circular issued notifying market participants
- **Immediate**: Compliance required upon notification

## Impact Assessment

The circular has high compliance significance but medium direct market impact. While the amendments affect only two specific individuals on the sanctions list, market participants including brokers, depositories, clearing corporations, and financial institutions must ensure their sanctions screening systems are updated. Non-compliance with UN Security Council sanctions and UAPA provisions can result in severe legal and regulatory consequences. The updated list is accessible on the ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee's website, and the UN Security Council Consolidated List is updated following all changes. Market participants should maintain robust AML/CFT frameworks and ensure ongoing monitoring against the consolidated sanctions list available at https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/sanctions/1267/aq_sanctions_list.
