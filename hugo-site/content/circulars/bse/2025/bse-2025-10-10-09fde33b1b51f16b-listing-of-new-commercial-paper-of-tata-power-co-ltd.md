## Impact Assessment

This is a routine short-term debt issuance with minimal market impact. Commercial paper is a common instrument used by corporates like Tata Power for managing working capital requirements. The strong credit ratings (A1+) indicate low credit risk. The listing provides institutional investors with a liquid, short-duration debt instrument. There is no impact on equity trading or retail investors. The discount pricing (Rs. 4,94,011 vs Rs. 5,00,000 face value) implies an implicit interest rate of approximately 4.97% for the 75-day period.
