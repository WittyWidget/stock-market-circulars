## Impact Assessment

Moderate impact on Anand Rayons Limited's trading liquidity. The addition of 1.84 million shares represents a significant increase in share count, but the 18-month lock-in period will temporarily restrict these shares from trading, limiting immediate market impact. Post lock-in expiry, increased float may improve liquidity but could create selling pressure.
