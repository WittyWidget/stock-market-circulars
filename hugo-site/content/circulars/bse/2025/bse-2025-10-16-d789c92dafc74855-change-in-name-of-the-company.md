## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This is a significant corporate action for one of India's largest automobile manufacturers. The name change to "PASSENGER VEHICLES LIMITED" suggests a strategic focus on the passenger vehicle segment, potentially indicating a business restructuring or demerger of passenger and commercial vehicle divisions.

**Operational Impact**: The rebranding will require substantial operational changes including updating all legal documents, marketing materials, signage, and digital presence. Stakeholders including customers, suppliers, and financial institutions will need to update their records.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders should note that this name change does not affect their shareholding rights or liabilities. The CIN remains unchanged, ensuring continuity of corporate identity for regulatory purposes. However, stock ticker symbols and trading identifiers may be updated by stock exchanges.

**Strategic Significance**: The transformation from TATA MOTORS (general) to TATA MOTORS PASSENGER VEHICLES LIMITED indicates a potential strategic realignment, possibly in preparation for separate listing or operational independence of the passenger vehicle business from commercial vehicles and other segments.
