## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular is issued in continuation of Exchange circular no. 20180423-42 dated April 23, 2018, which originally launched the non-competitive bidding facility for Government Securities auctions conducted by RBI.

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational announcement for the debt market segment. The impact on equity markets is negligible. For government securities market participants, institutional investors, and banks, this provides an opportunity to participate in sovereign debt auctions through the non-competitive bidding route. The four securities span short to long-term maturities (2028-2055), offering options across the yield curve. Total issue size of Rs. 32,000 crores represents standard government borrowing program activity.
