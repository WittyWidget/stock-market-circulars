## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements tighter price band restrictions for the listed securities as part of BSE's surveillance measures. Price bands limit the maximum percentage change in a security's price during a trading session, serving as a circuit breaker mechanism to control excessive volatility.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must enforce the revised price bands from October 17, 2025
- Orders exceeding the new price band limits will be rejected
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect the new price band parameters
- Members should communicate these changes to their clients trading in affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 16, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The revision of price bands to more restrictive levels (particularly 2% and 5% bands) indicates enhanced surveillance on these securities, likely due to concerns about volatility, liquidity, or other market integrity issues. Trading in these securities will be more constrained, potentially affecting liquidity and price discovery. Investors and traders should exercise caution and be aware that these restrictions may limit their ability to enter or exit positions at desired price levels during volatile market conditions.
