title: BSE Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Framework Updates -
  August 19, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has updated its Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective August 19, 2025. Seven securities are being added to the ST-ASM framework, while five securities are moving out. The circular provides consolidated lists of all securities currently under various stages of ST-ASM surveillance.

## Key Points

- 7 new securities added to ST-ASM framework (Stage I)
- 5 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages
- Framework includes both mainboard and SME securities
- T+0 scrips included based on parent company surveillance

## Securities Added to ST-ASM Framework

**New Additions (Stage I):**
- Arrow Greentech Ltd (516064)
- Bafna Pharmaceuticals Ltd (532989)
- Davin Sons Retail Ltd (544331) - SME
- Digispice Technologies Ltd (517214)
- Eureka Industries Ltd (521137)
- Flexituff Ventures International Ltd (533638)
- Sharma East India Hospitals & Medical Research Ltd (524548)

## Securities Removed from ST-ASM Framework

- Adcounty Media India Ltd (544435) - SME
- Franklin Industries Ltd (540190)
- Sambhv Steel Tubes Ltd (544430)
- Sarda Energy & Minerals Ltd (504614 and T+0 variant 104614)

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to operate with staged surveillance measures (5/15/30 days) designed to curb excessive speculation and volatility in securities. Securities under this framework face additional margin requirements and other trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with additional margin requirements for ST-ASM securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in listed securities
- Monitoring of price movements and trading patterns in affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** August 19, 2025
- Changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 7 securities to ST-ASM framework will increase trading costs and reduce liquidity for these stocks due to higher margin requirements. Investors in these securities should expect increased volatility monitoring and potential trading restrictions. The removal of 5 securities provides relief from surveillance measures, potentially improving liquidity and reducing trading costs for those stocks.
