title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) - Changes to Securities List Effective
  October 20, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced comprehensive changes to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective October 20, 2025. The circular details four categories of changes: 4 securities newly added to ESM, 28 securities moving out of ESM, 3 securities moving to higher ESM stages, and 14 securities moving to lower ESM stages. The ESM framework is a surveillance mechanism designed to alert investors about securities with unusual price movements or trading patterns.

## Key Points

- 4 new securities added to ESM: Chartered Capital & Investment Ltd, Evoq Remedies Ltd, Jeevan Scientific Technology Ltd, and Organic Coatings Ltd
- 28 securities removed from ESM framework including AGS Transact Technologies, Bihar Sponge Iron, Parsvnath Developers, and 25 others
- 3 securities escalated to higher ESM stages: Anka India Ltd, Elango Industries Ltd, and Milestone Furniture Ltd
- 14 securities downgraded to lower ESM stages including Agio Paper & Industries, Anand Rayons, and Refex Renewables & Infrastructure
- Changes effective from October 20, 2025
- Framework includes both mainboard and SME scrips

## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework continues to be applied as a graduated surveillance mechanism. Securities are placed under ESM based on criteria such as high-low price variation, client concentration, and market capitalization concerns. The framework operates in multiple stages with progressively stringent surveillance measures. Movement between stages occurs based on ongoing assessment of trading patterns and compliance parameters.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised ESM classification for all affected securities
- Enhanced margin requirements and trading restrictions apply to securities under ESM
- Investors trading in ESM securities should be aware of additional surveillance measures
- Market participants must comply with stage-specific requirements for securities remaining in ESM but moving to different stages
- SME scrips are marked with # symbol for identification
- Securities marked with ~ indicate specific NSE classification

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 20, 2025 - All ESM changes become applicable
- **Circular Date**: October 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The removal of 28 securities from ESM will improve liquidity and reduce trading restrictions for these stocks, potentially benefiting existing investors. Conversely, 4 new additions will face enhanced surveillance with potential trading limitations.

**Trading Impact**: Securities moved to higher ESM stages (3 stocks) will face stricter surveillance measures including higher margins and additional disclosure requirements, which may reduce trading activity. The 14 securities downgraded to lower ESM stages will experience relaxed restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding securities newly added to or upgraded within ESM should expect increased volatility monitoring, potential margin calls, and trading restrictions. Those holding securities exiting ESM will benefit from normalized trading conditions.

**Risk Mitigation**: The ESM framework serves as an early warning system for investors about securities with abnormal trading patterns, helping reduce market manipulation risks and protecting retail investors from excessive speculation.
