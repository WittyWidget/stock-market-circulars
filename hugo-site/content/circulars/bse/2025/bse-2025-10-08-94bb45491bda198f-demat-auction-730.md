## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects 106 securities across multiple sectors. While the auction quantities are relatively small for most scrips, some securities like INOX GREEN E, WELCURE DRUG, and Kamdhenu Limited have significant volumes that could impact short-term price discovery.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - Members with delivery shortfalls must arrange for securities through the auction process, which may result in additional costs if auction prices exceed market prices.
