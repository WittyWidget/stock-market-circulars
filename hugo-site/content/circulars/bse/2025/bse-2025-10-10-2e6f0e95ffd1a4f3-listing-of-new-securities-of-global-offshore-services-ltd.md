## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The addition of 35,000 shares represents a relatively small increase in outstanding shares. Given the preferential nature of the issue and lock-in restrictions until April 30, 2026, there will be no immediate supply pressure on the stock.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to non-promoter preferential allottees who received shares through warrant conversion. These shareholders cannot trade their holdings until the lock-in period expires.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible immediate impact on liquidity as locked-in shares cannot be traded for approximately 6.5 months from the trading commencement date.

**Operational Impact**: Routine listing update requiring no special operational changes from trading members or market participants.
