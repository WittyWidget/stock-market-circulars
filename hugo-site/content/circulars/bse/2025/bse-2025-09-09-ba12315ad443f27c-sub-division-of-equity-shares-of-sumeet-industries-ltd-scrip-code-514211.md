## Summary

Sumeet Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 514211) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares, converting each existing equity share of Rs. 10/- face value into five equity shares of Rs. 2/- face value each. The record date for this corporate action is set for October 3, 2025.

## Key Points

- Sub-division ratio: 1 share of Rs. 10/- becomes 5 shares of Rs. 2/- each
- Record date: October 3, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE235C01028) for Rs. 10/- shares will become invalid from October 3, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs. 2/- shares will be communicated separately
- Effective date for new face value: October 3, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE235C01028 for Rs. 10/- paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after October 3, 2025. A new ISIN number for the Rs. 2/- paid-up shares will be issued and communicated to the market through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the change in share structure and ensure proper handling of transactions post the effective date. Investors holding shares in dematerialized form will automatically receive the subdivided shares in the ratio of 1:5.

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: October 3, 2025
- **Effective Date for New Face Value**: October 3, 2025
- **ISIN Validity Cutoff**: October 2, 2025 (last day for old ISIN transactions)

## Impact Assessment

This sub-division will make shares more affordable and potentially increase liquidity. Existing shareholders will hold five times the number of shares at one-fifth the face value, with no change in their proportionate ownership or total investment value. The action may attract more retail investors due to lower absolute share prices.
