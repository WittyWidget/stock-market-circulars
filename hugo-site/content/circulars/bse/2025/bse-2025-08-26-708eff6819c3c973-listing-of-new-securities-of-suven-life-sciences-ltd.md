## Key Points

- 91,86,490 new equity shares of Rs. 1/- each listed
- Issue price: Rs. 134/- (Rs. 1 face value + Rs. 133 premium)
- Securities rank pari-passu with existing equity shares
- Distribution numbers: 218073718 to 227260207
- Date of allotment: July 16, 2025
- ISIN: INE495B01038

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. Standard listing procedure for warrant conversion.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members informed of new securities availability for trading
- Lock-in restrictions apply to all newly issued shares
- Shares subject to standard listing compliance requirements

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: July 16, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: August 28, 2025
- **Lock-in Period End**: March 9, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing increases Suven Life Sciences' equity base significantly with nearly 92 lakh new shares. The 18-month lock-in period until March 2026 means these shares cannot be freely traded immediately, limiting short-term supply impact. The preferential allotment to non-promoters may dilute existing shareholding patterns.
