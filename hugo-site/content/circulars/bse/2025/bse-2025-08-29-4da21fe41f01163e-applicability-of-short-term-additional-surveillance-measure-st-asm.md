## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective September 1, 2025. Six securities are being added to the ST-ASM framework while eight securities are moving out of it. The circular provides consolidated lists of all securities under various stages of ST-ASM.

## Key Points

- 6 securities newly shortlisted for ST-ASM framework (5/15/30 days)
- 8 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework
- No securities moving between higher or lower ASM stages
- Consolidated list includes securities across different ASM stages
- Special markings for SME scrips (@) and securities moving to other frameworks

## Securities Moving Into ST-ASM

**New Additions (effective September 1, 2025):**
- Gogia Capital Growth Ltd (531600)
- Sangal Papers Ltd (516096)
- Scan Projects Ltd (531797)
- Swashthik Plascon Ltd (544035) - SME scrip
- Swojas Foods Ltd (530217)
- Titan Biotech Ltd (524717)

## Securities Moving Out of ST-ASM

**Removals (effective September 1, 2025):**
- Cropster Agro Ltd (523105)
- Filmcity Media Ltd (531486)
- Naturewings Holidays Ltd (544245)

- Pradhin Ltd (530095)
- Prospect Consumer Products Ltd (543814) - moving to ESM

- Spinaroo Commercial Ltd (544392)

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: September 1, 2025
- All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable from this date

## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework imposes additional margin requirements and trading restrictions on volatile securities. Securities entering the framework will face enhanced surveillance and potentially higher trading costs, while those exiting will see relaxed restrictions. The movement of some securities to ESM framework indicates continued regulatory oversight through alternative surveillance measures.
