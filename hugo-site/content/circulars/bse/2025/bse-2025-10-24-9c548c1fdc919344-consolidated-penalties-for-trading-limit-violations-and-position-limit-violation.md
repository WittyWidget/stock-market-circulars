title: Consolidated Penalties for Trading-Limit and Position-Limit Violations Across
  Segments
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a consolidated summary of penalties applicable for trading limit violations (RRM violations) and position limit violations across equity cash, equity derivatives, currency derivatives, and securities lending & borrowing segments. The circular provides a unified reference document detailing penalty structures that escalate based on violation frequency, amount, and segment. Penalties range from 0.07% per day plus fixed amounts to referral to the Member Committee for persistent violators.

## Key Points

- Trading limit violations incur 0.07% per day penalty plus escalating fixed penalties based on violation frequency and amount
- Position limit violations at trading member/FPI/mutual fund level in equity derivatives attract 1% of violation value (minimum Rs 5,000, maximum Rs 1,00,000 per entity per stock per day)
- From the 11th violation instance onwards in a calendar month, members are referred to the Member Committee for suitable action
- Penalties differentiate between violations â‰¤ Rs 1 crore and > Rs 1 crore with higher fixed penalties for larger violations
- Currency derivatives position limit violations have no penalty for first instance, escalating from Rs 5,000 to Rs 70,000+ for repeated violations
- Client level position limit violations in currency derivatives attract Rs 5,000 per violation per client per day
- Securities lending & borrowing segment has separate penalty structures for both trading limit and position limit violations
- Entity level penalties during ban period are 1% of violation value (minimum Rs 5,000, maximum Rs 1,00,000)

## Regulatory Changes

This circular does not introduce new penalties but consolidates existing penalty structures across segments for ease of reference. The standardized framework ensures consistent application of penalties:

- **Equity Cash, Equity & Currency Derivatives Trading Limits**: Progressive penalty structure from 1st instance (0.07% per day) to 11th+ instance (0.07% + Rs 14,000/Rs 70,000 cumulative + Rs 2,000/Rs 10,000 per instance)
- **Securities Lending & Borrowing Trading Limits**: Similar progressive structure with penalties ranging from 0.07% per day to 0.07% + Rs 10,000 per instance + Member Committee referral
- **Position Limit Framework**: Standardized across segments with specific thresholds and referral mechanisms

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must monitor and ensure compliance with trading limits (RRM) across all segments to avoid escalating penalties
- **Clearing Members**: Responsible for paying penalties on behalf of clients who violate position limits; may recover amounts from violating clients
- **All Members**: Must track violation instances within calendar month as penalties escalate based on frequency
- **Position Monitoring**: Members must ensure clients do not exceed position limits in equity derivatives, currency derivatives, and securities lending segments
- **Record Keeping**: Members should maintain records of violations to understand cumulative penalty exposure and potential Member Committee referrals

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 24, 2025
- **Notice Number**: 20251024-2
- **Effective Date**: Immediate (consolidation of existing penalty structures)
- **Violation Counting Period**: Calendar month basis for determining instance count and penalty escalation

## Impact Assessment

**High Impact** - This consolidated framework affects all trading and clearing members across equity, currency, derivatives, and securities lending segments. Key impacts include:

- **Financial Impact**: Repeated violations can result in substantial cumulative penalties (e.g., 11th+ violation in equity derivatives with >Rs 1 crore amount incurs 0.07% per day + Rs 70,000 cumulative + Rs 10,000 per additional instance)
- **Operational Impact**: Members must implement robust risk management and monitoring systems to track trading limits and position limits in real-time across multiple segments
- **Compliance Risk**: Members with 11+ violations face referral to Member Committee, potentially leading to additional sanctions including suspension of trading privileges
- **Client Management**: Clearing members must recover penalties from violating clients, requiring enhanced client monitoring and communication processes
- **Deterrent Effect**: Progressive penalty structure creates strong incentive for members to prevent violations through better pre-trade risk controls
- **Transparency**: Consolidated format improves clarity for members regarding penalty exposure across all segments
