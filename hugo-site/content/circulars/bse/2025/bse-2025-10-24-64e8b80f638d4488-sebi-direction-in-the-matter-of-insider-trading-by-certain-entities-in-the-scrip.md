title: SEBI Direction in Insider Trading Matter - Arun Khurana vs IndusInd Bank -
  Securities Appellate Tribunal Order
---

## Summary

The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) Mumbai issued an order on October 10, 2025 in Appeal No. 412 of 2025 filed by Arun Khurana against SEBI. The Tribunal modified the terms of deposit required in a SEBI insider trading enforcement matter involving IndusInd Bank Limited. While SEBI's original ex-parte order required deposit of the full impounding amount in a fixed deposit with lien marked to SEBI, the Tribunal's September 25, 2025 order required only 50% deposit with SEBI. The appellant requested permission to place the 50% amount in a fixed deposit in the appellant's name with a lien marked in favour of SEBI, which was granted with a four-week deadline for compliance.

## Key Points

- SAT's September 25, 2025 order reduced requirement to 50% of the amount
- Tribunal granted appellant's request to deposit 50% in fixed deposit in appellant's name with lien in favour of SEBI
- Appellant undertook to deposit the amount within four weeks from October 10, 2025
- SEBI's counsel had no objection to the modified arrangement

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Arun Khurana must deposit 50% of the impounding amount in a fixed deposit within four weeks from October 10, 2025 (deadline: November 7, 2025)
- The fixed deposit must be in the appellant's name with a lien marked in favour of SEBI
- This arrangement replaces SEBI's original requirement of full deposit directly with SEBI

## Important Dates

- **October 10, 2025**: SAT order date
- **November 7, 2025**: Deadline for deposit (four weeks from October 10, 2025)
- **September 25, 2025**: Date of prior SAT order reducing deposit requirement to 50%

## Impact Assessment

This order has limited market impact as it pertains to a specific enforcement case against an individual. However, it demonstrates the Tribunal's willingness to modify deposit arrangements in insider trading matters while maintaining SEBI's security interest through lien arrangements. The case serves as a precedent for how deposit requirements may be structured in insider trading enforcement actions, balancing regulatory interests with appellant rights. Market participants facing similar enforcement actions may reference this order when negotiating deposit terms during appeal proceedings.
