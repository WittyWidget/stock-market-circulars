## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The shut periods temporarily restrict SLB liquidity for 30 securities, affecting short-selling and hedging strategies. Major blue-chip stocks like Infosys, Hindustan Unilever, and Dabur are included, which may impact institutional trading strategies.

**Operational Impact:** Market participants engaged in SLB activities must plan around these shut periods. The inclusion of high-volume securities may increase temporary demand for alternative hedging instruments during shut periods.

**Investor Impact:** Regular equity trading remains unaffected. Only securities lending and borrowing operations are restricted during the specified periods. Investors with existing SLB positions should note foreclosure dates for amalgamation cases to avoid forced closures.
