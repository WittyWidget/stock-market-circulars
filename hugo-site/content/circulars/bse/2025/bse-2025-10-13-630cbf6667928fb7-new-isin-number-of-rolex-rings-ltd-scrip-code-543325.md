## Summary

BSE has issued a new ISIN number INE645S01024 for Rolex Rings Ltd (Scrip Code: 543325) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs.10/- to Re.1/-. This change is in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251006-63 dated October 06, 2025, and will become effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of October 17, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN number: INE645S01024
- Company: Rolex Rings Ltd (Scrip Code: 543325)
- Corporate action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Re.1/-
- Effective date: October 17, 2025 (Ex-Date)
- DR reference: 738/2025-2026
- Notice issued by: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President â€“ Listing Operations (CRD)

## Regulatory Changes

The equity shares of Rolex Rings Ltd will trade under a new ISIN number following the stock split. The old ISIN will be replaced by INE645S01024 for all trading and settlement purposes from the ex-date onwards. This is a standard procedure when the face value of shares changes due to sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number INE645S01024
- All trades executed on or after October 17, 2025 must use the new ISIN
- Depositories and custodians need to update their records to reflect the new ISIN
- Market participants should ensure their back-office systems are configured for the face value change from Rs.10 to Re.1

## Important Dates

- **October 06, 2025**: Original notice date (Notice No. 20251006-63)
- **October 13, 2025**: Current circular issue date
- **October 17, 2025**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The 10:1 stock split (from Rs.10 to Re.1 face value) will increase the number of outstanding shares tenfold while reducing the per-share price proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members, custodians, and market infrastructure providers must update their systems to handle the new ISIN. Existing shareholders will automatically receive the split shares in their demat accounts. The split does not change the market capitalization or ownership percentage of existing shareholders.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders will receive 10 shares of Re.1 face value for every 1 share of Rs.10 face value held. All corporate benefits and rights remain proportionate to the shareholding.
