## Summary

BSE will transfer Benara Bearings and Pistons Ltd (scrip code: 541178) to the "MT" group effective August 8, 2025, due to non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulation 33 for quarterly financial disclosure requirements. The company failed to submit financial results for half-year periods ended September 2024 and March 2025.

## Key Points

- Benara Bearings and Pistons Ltd will be moved to MT group unless compliance is achieved by August 5, 2025
- 37 other companies already in Z/MT groups remain non-compliant for December 2024 and March 2025 quarters
- All trades in Z/MT group scrips will be settled on Trade for Trade basis
- Action based on SEBI Master Circular dated November 11, 2024

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of SEBI's penal framework for non-compliance with quarterly financial disclosure requirements under Regulation 33 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must submit quarterly and half-yearly financial results as per prescribed timelines
- Companies failing to comply face transfer to restricted trading groups (Z/MT)
- Trade for Trade settlement mechanism applies to restricted scrips
- Companies must rectify compliance before specified deadlines to avoid penalties

## Important Dates

- **August 5, 2025**: Final deadline for Benara Bearings and Pistons Ltd to achieve compliance
- **August 8, 2025**: Effective date for transfer to MT group if non-compliance persists
- **July 28, 2025**: Notice date
