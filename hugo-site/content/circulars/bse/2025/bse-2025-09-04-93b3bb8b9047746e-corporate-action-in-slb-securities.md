title: Corporate Action in SLB Securities - Dividend and Buyback Updates
---

## Summary

BSE has announced corporate actions for 22 securities, comprising 21 dividend declarations and 1 share buyback. The circular provides specific record dates, ex-dates, and shut periods for Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) operations for each affected security.

## Key Points

- 21 companies declaring dividends with record dates ranging from September 5 to September 23, 2025
- 1 share buyback by Bajaj Consumer Care Limited with record date September 5, 2025
- All securities will have specific shut periods during which SLB operations will be suspended
- Ex-dates generally coincide with record dates, except for a few securities
- Shut periods typically span 1-3 days leading up to and including the record date

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing corporate action procedures for SLB securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- SLB participants must note the shut periods when securities lending and borrowing will be suspended
- Trading members should inform clients about upcoming corporate actions and their impact on positions
- Settlement obligations must be completed before shut periods commence

## Important Dates

- **September 4, 2025**: Ex-date for Bajaj Consumer Care buyback
- **September 5, 2025**: Record date for Bajaj Consumer Care buyback and Supriya Lifescience dividend
- **September 9, 2025**: Record date for Gujarat State Fertilizers, BLS International, and RBL Bank dividends
- **September 12, 2025**: Record date for K.P. Energy, Mastek, KPI Green Energy, and Techno Electric dividends
- **September 15-23, 2025**: Various record dates for remaining dividend declarations

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Moderate impact on SLB operations with temporary suspension during shut periods. Securities will be unavailable for lending/borrowing during specified periods.

**Market Impact**: Standard corporate action processing with no unusual market disruption expected. Dividend-paying stocks may see typical pre-record date trading patterns.

**Operational Impact**: SLB participants need to adjust their lending/borrowing strategies around the shut periods to avoid settlement issues.
