## Regulatory Changes

Price bands are being tightened from their existing levels as a surveillance mechanism. This limits the maximum price movement allowed in a single trading session, helping to curb excessive volatility and speculative trading.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all orders comply with the new price band limits
- Systems should be updated to reflect the revised bands before market open on October 14, 2025
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 13, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 14, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements, potentially reducing liquidity and increasing the time required for price discovery in these securities.

**Market Participants**: Traders and investors in these scrips will face tighter limits on daily price fluctuations. Day traders may find reduced profit opportunities, while long-term investors may experience less volatility.

**Surveillance Context**: The implementation of tighter price bands suggests these securities may have exhibited unusual price movements or volatility patterns that warranted enhanced surveillance measures.
