## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. This is a private placement of infrastructure debt securities with institutional participation only.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members gain access to two new AAA-rated debt instruments for their institutional clients. The securities provide diversification options in the infrastructure financing sector with tenors of approximately 5 years and 10 years.

**Investor Impact:** Limited to qualified institutional buyers and high net-worth individuals who participate in private placements. The high face value (Rs. 1 lakh) restricts retail participation.
