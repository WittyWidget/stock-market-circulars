**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects holders and traders of AAHL debentures (scrip 976065). The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value per debenture to Rs. 79,087, which impacts the nominal value of holdings and future interest calculations.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems and member records must be updated to reflect the new reduced face value. Debenture holders will receive partial redemption proceeds, reducing their investment exposure to AAHL debt instruments.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will experience partial capital return through the redemption, with remaining holdings valued at the reduced face value. Future coupon payments will be calculated on the reduced face value of Rs. 79,087 per debenture.
