## Regulatory Changes

Price band modifications represent a surveillance measure under BSE's framework to manage excessive volatility. The varying levels of restrictions (2%, 5%, 10%, 20%) suggest differentiated risk assessments for each security. Tighter bands limit daily price movements to prevent speculative trading and protect investor interests.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands from October 09, 2025
- All trading systems and risk management protocols must be updated to reflect new price limits
- Orders exceeding the revised price bands will be rejected
- Members requiring clarifications should contact BSE Surveillance at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 08, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 09, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements, particularly for the 9 securities with 2% bands. This will reduce volatility but may also impact liquidity and trading volumes.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding these securities will experience limited price discovery and reduced ability to execute trades at desired prices during volatile market conditions. The restrictions may extend holding periods for those seeking exits.

**Market Operations**: Stricter price bands indicate heightened surveillance concerns, possibly due to unusual price movements, low liquidity, or corporate governance issues in these securities. The 20% bands on Sampat Aluminium and VMS TMT suggest these require broader trading ranges while still under monitoring.
