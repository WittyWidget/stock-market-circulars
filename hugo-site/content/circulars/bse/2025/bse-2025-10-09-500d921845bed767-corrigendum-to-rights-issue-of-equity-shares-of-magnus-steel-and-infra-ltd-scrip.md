title: Corrigendum to Rights Issue of Equity Shares of Magnus Steel and Infra Ltd
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a corrigendum revising the rights issue ratio for Magnus Steel and Infra Ltd (Scrip Code: 517320). The revised ratio is 29 equity shares of Rs. 10/- each for every 2 equity shares held, at par value. The record date remains October 10, 2025, and the ex-rights date is also October 10, 2025 (Settlement No. DR-733/2025-2026).

## Key Points

- Revised rights issue ratio: 29 equity shares for every 2 existing equity shares held
- Face value and issue price: Rs. 10/- per share (at par)
- Payment terms: Full issue price payable on application
- Security type: Dematerialised securities in rolling settlement segment
- Previous notice superseded: Exchange Notice No. 20251007-61 dated October 07, 2025
- All other terms from earlier notice remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

This corrigendum modifies only the rights issue ratio previously communicated. The original ratio has been revised to 29:2 (29 new shares for every 2 shares held).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised rights issue ratio
- Shareholders must ensure their holdings are in dematerialised form
- Issue price of Rs. 10/- per share is payable in full at the time of application
- Entitlement calculations should be based on shareholding as on record date

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Ex-Rights Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Settlement Number**: DR-733/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

This corrigendum significantly changes shareholder entitlements compared to the original announcement. The revised ratio of 29:2 represents a substantial rights offering that will materially dilute existing shareholding percentages unless shareholders fully subscribe to their entitlements. Existing shareholders of Magnus Steel and Infra Ltd need to recalculate their entitlements and funding requirements based on this corrected ratio.
