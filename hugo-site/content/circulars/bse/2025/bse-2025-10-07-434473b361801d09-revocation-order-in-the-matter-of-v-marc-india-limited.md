## Summary

SEBI has revoked all directions issued against Ms. Rekha Kurani (PAN: AQCPK5061H) in the V Marc India Limited IPO irregularities matter. The revocation order was issued under Sections 11(1), 11(4), 11B and 19 of the SEBI Act, 1992, after a detailed investigation concluded that her involvement in the irregularities could not be established.

## Key Points

- Ms. Rekha Kurani was initially restrained from buying, selling, or dealing in securities through an ad interim ex parte order dated February 28, 2024
- The interim order was confirmed on July 26, 2024 with certain modifications
- A total of 12 entities were initially restrained in the V Marc India Limited IPO case
- The interim order also directed impounding of wrongful gains and deposit into Escrow/Savings Account with SEBI lien
- Banks were directed to prevent debits from accounts except for transfers to the Escrow/Savings Account
- After completion of detailed investigation, SEBI found insufficient evidence to establish Ms. Kurani's involvement
- All restrictions against Ms. Rekha Kurani have been revoked with immediate effect

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a case-specific revocation order that removes previously imposed restrictions on one individual.

## Compliance Requirements

- Stock Exchanges, Banks, and Depositories have been notified to take necessary action to implement the revocation
- No further compliance obligations for Ms. Rekha Kurani as all directions have been revoked
- Other entities involved in the V Marc India Limited case (the remaining 11 entities) remain subject to the original orders

## Important Dates

- **February 28, 2024**: Original ad interim ex parte order issued
- **July 26, 2024**: Confirmatory order issued with modifications
- **October 07, 2025**: Revocation order issued with immediate effect

## Impact Assessment

**Individual Impact**: Ms. Rekha Kurani can now resume normal securities market activities without restrictions.

**Market Impact**: Minimal market-wide impact as this affects only one individual in a specific investigation. The order demonstrates SEBI's commitment to fair enforcement and willingness to revoke restrictions when involvement cannot be established.

**Procedural Significance**: Illustrates SEBI's two-stage process of issuing interim protective orders followed by detailed investigation, with appropriate remedial action when evidence is insufficient.
