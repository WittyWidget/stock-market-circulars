## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the listing of these new securities
- All 3,50,000 shares are subject to mandatory lock-in requirements

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** September 3, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** October 20, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry:** January 2, 2026 (for all 3,50,000 shares, Dist. Nos. 17930001 to 18280000)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a small preferential issue of 350,000 shares for a relatively small company. The shares are locked-in until January 2026, preventing immediate trading activity.

**Shareholding Impact:** The shares were issued to Non-Promoters, potentially diluting existing shareholding, but the quantum is modest.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal immediate impact on liquidity as all shares are under lock-in for approximately 2.5 months from listing date.

**Investor Consideration:** Existing shareholders should note the dilution from this preferential issue. The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares once the lock-in expires.
