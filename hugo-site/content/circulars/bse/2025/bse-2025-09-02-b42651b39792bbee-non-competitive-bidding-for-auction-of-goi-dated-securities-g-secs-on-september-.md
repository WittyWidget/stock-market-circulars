## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the NCB-GSec module on BSE's iBBS platform for bidding

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is a routine government securities auction. The total issue size of ₹25,000 crores (₹11,000 crores for 6.28% GS 2032 and ₹14,000 crores for 7.09% GS 2074) represents standard government borrowing activity. The non-competitive bidding facility ensures retail and smaller institutional investors can participate without competing on price.
