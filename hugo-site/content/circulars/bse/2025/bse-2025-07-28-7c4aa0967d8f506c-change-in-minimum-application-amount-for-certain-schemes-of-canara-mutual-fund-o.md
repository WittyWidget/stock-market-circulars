title: Change in Minimum Application Amount for certain schemes of Canara Mutual Fund
  on BSE StAR MF platform
---

## Summary

Canara Robeco Mutual Fund has revised the minimum application amounts for Canara Robeco Large Cap Fund (formerly Canara Robeco Blue Chip Equity Fund) on BSE StAR MF platform, effective July 28, 2025. The changes substantially reduce minimum investment requirements across various transaction types.

## Key Points

- Lumpsum investment minimum reduced from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 100
- Additional purchase minimum reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100
- Minimum redemption/switch-out amount reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100
- STP minimum for all frequencies standardized to Rs. 100 (previously varied from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 2,000)
- SWP minimum for all frequencies standardized to Rs. 100 (previously varied from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 2,000)
- Changes apply to Canara Robeco Large Cap Fund specifically

## Regulatory Changes

This is an operational change in mutual fund scheme parameters rather than a regulatory mandate. The revision updates the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) of the affected fund.

## Compliance Requirements

- Updated SID and KIM documentation reflects the new minimum amounts
- BSE StAR MF platform will implement the revised transaction limits
- Investors can now transact with significantly lower minimum amounts

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 28, 2025
- All revised minimum amounts applicable from the effective date

## Impact Assessment

The dramatic reduction in minimum investment amounts (from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 100 for lumpsum investments) makes mutual fund investing more accessible to retail investors with smaller amounts. This democratization of investment access could potentially increase participation in equity mutual funds through the BSE StAR MF platform.
