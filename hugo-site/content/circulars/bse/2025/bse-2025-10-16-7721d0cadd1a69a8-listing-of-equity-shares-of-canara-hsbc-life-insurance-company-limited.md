## Impact Assessment

The listing provides market access to Canara HSBC Life Insurance Company Limited shares. However, immediate liquidity is limited as approximately 82.45% of shares are under lock-in. Only 17.55% (16,67,15,000 shares) are available for trading immediately. Liquidity will gradually increase as lock-in periods expire, with significant unlocking expected in November 2025 (anchor investors) and April 2026 (major block). This staged release helps prevent market flooding and supports price stability during the initial trading period.
