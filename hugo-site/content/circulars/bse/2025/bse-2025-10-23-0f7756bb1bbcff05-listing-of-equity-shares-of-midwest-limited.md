## Impact Assessment

**Liquidity Impact**: Approximately 81.9% of total equity shares (2,96,84,362 shares) are under various lock-in periods, limiting immediate tradable float. Gradual unlock will occur with first significant release in November 2025 (anchor investors) and April 2026 (AIF and some promoter holdings).

**Market Impact**: Medium - The staggered lock-in expiry prevents sudden supply shock. The exemption for AIF Category II holdings (14.09 lakh shares) provides some immediate liquidity. Investors should monitor lock-in expiry dates as they may impact share price volatility.

**Investor Considerations**: Public IPO investors have full liquidity (29.68 lakh shares). Anchor investors face near-term restrictions. Long-term promoter lock-in (until 2026-2028) demonstrates commitment but may concern investors seeking exit flexibility.
