## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The stock split will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10x while proportionally reducing the share price, making shares more affordable for retail investors. This typically enhances liquidity and trading volumes.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems, portfolios, and settlement processes must be updated to reflect the new share structure. The change in ISIN requires coordination between exchanges, depositories, and market participants.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. The overall investment value remains unchanged, but the number of shares held increases proportionally.
