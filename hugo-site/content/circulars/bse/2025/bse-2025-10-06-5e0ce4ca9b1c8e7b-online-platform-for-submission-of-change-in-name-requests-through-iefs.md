## Summary

BSE has provided a user manual detailing the step-by-step process for clearing members to submit change in name requests through the IEFS (Issuer Electronic Filing System) portal at https://iefs.bseindia.in. The circular outlines the login procedure and form submission process, with automated email confirmations upon successful submission.

## Key Points

- Members must access IEFS portal at https://iefs.bseindia.in for name change requests
- Member code and login ID are both the clearing code (e.g., 123456)
- First-time users must reset password using the 'forget password' option
- Successful submissions trigger pop-up confirmation and email notification to registered email ID
- Navigation path: IEFS >> Change in Name >> Change in Name Form

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This circular provides operational guidance for using an existing online platform.

## Compliance Requirements

- Clearing members must use the IEFS portal for submitting change in name requests
- Members must have valid credentials (clearing code) to access the system
- First-time users must complete password reset process

## Important Dates

No specific dates mentioned. The system is available for ongoing use.

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This is an operational enhancement that digitizes the name change request submission process for clearing members. The online platform streamlines administrative procedures and provides automated confirmation, improving efficiency for member firms. No impact on trading activities or market participants beyond clearing members.
