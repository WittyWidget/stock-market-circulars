## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: May 6, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: October 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment to promoters increases the paid-up capital of Vanta Bioscience Limited. However, since all new shares are locked-in for approximately 18 months from the notice date, there will be no immediate increase in tradable float. The issuance demonstrates promoter confidence and capital infusion into the company.
