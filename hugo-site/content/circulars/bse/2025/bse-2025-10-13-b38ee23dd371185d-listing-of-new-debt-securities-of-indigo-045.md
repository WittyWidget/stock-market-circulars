## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt security listing with minimal market impact. The securities are issued on private placement basis and will be traded only in dematerialized form, indicating institutional participation. The CARE AAA (SO) credit rating suggests strong credit quality. The high face value of Rs. 10 crore per security limits participation to institutional investors and high net worth individuals. Monthly interest payments provide regular cash flow to investors over the 4-year tenure.
