## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The preferential allotment of 15.82 lakh shares to Promoters represents capital infusion into Hubtown Limited. The shares were issued at Rs. 220 per share, indicating promoter confidence. However, the complete lock-in until May 2027 ensures no immediate supply pressure on stock price.

**Operational Impact**: Positive for the company as it represents fundraising through warrant conversion. The funds raised (approximately Rs. 34.8 crores) can be utilized for business operations and growth.

**Investor Impact**: Neutral to positive. Promoter participation in preferential allotment typically signals confidence, but the dilution effect and locked-in nature means no immediate trading impact from these shares.
