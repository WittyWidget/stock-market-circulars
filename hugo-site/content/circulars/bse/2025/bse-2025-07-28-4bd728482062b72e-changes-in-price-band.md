title: Price Band Revisions for 13 Securities Effective July 29, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 13 securities effective from July 29, 2025. The price bands range from 2% to 20%, with most securities having their bands set at 5%. These changes are implemented as surveillance measures to control volatility.

## Key Points

- 13 securities affected by price band revisions
- Changes effective from July 29, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% to 20%
- Glen Industries Ltd receives the highest price band of 20%
- Six securities have their price bands set at 5%
- Three securities receive the lowest price band of 2%

## Regulatory Changes

Price band adjustments are surveillance measures that limit the maximum price movement of securities during trading sessions. These bands help control excessive volatility and protect investors from sudden price swings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with revised price bands
- All trades must occur within the specified price band limits
- Surveillance team contact available at bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications

## Important Dates

- **July 28, 2025**: Circular issued
- **July 29, 2025**: Revised price bands become effective

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will limit daily price movements for the affected securities, potentially reducing volatility but also restricting price discovery. Securities with lower price bands (2-5%) will have more constrained trading ranges, while Glen Industries with a 20% band retains higher flexibility.
