This listing has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to privately placed debt securities of Progfin Private Limited. The impact is limited to:

- Debt market participants interested in BBB+ rated corporate bonds
- Existing and potential investors in Progfin Private Limited securities
- Trading members who may facilitate transactions in these securities

The securities offer an 11% annual return with monthly interest payments, which may attract fixed-income investors seeking regular cash flows.
