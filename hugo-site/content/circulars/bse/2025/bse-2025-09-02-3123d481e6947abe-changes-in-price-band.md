## Impact Assessment

The revision in price bands will impact trading volatility and liquidity for the affected securities. Securities with tighter bands (2% and 5%) may experience reduced intraday volatility but potentially lower liquidity, while those with wider bands (10% and 20%) will have greater flexibility for price discovery but increased potential for volatility. Traders and investors in these securities should adjust their trading strategies accordingly to account for the new price movement limits.
