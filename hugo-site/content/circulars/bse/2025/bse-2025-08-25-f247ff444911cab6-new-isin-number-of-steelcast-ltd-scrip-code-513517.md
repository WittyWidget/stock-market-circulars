title: New ISIN Number for STEELCAST LTD Following Share Sub-division
---

## Summary

STEELCAST LTD (Scrip Code: 513517) has been assigned a new ISIN number INE124E01038 following the sub-division of its equity shares from Rs.5/- per share to Re.1/- per share. The new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from August 29, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: STEELCAST LTD (Scrip Code: 513517)
- New ISIN Number: INE124E01038
- Share sub-division: From Rs.5/- per share to Re.1/- per share
- Effective date for new ISIN: August 29, 2025 (Ex-Date)
- Document reference: DR-704/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

The new ISIN number replaces the previous identification for STEELCAST LTD equity shares following the completion of share sub-division process. This change updates the securities identification system to reflect the new face value of Re.1/- per equity share.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN number INE124E01038 for all trades in STEELCAST LTD equity shares from August 29, 2025
- All trading systems and records must be updated to reflect the new ISIN
- Existing shareholders will receive sub-divided shares in the ratio corresponding to the face value change

## Important Dates

- **August 29, 2025**: Ex-Date for new ISIN effectiveness
- **August 25, 2025**: Notice issue date
- **August 11, 2025**: Previous related notice date (20250811-45)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action that will not significantly impact market operations. The share sub-division increases the number of shares outstanding while proportionally reducing the face value, maintaining the same market capitalization. Trading members need to ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN number to avoid any trading disruptions from the ex-date.
