- Both companies reaffirm commitment to timely and accurate disclosure obligations
- Media reports do not have any impact on Deccan Cements' operations

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must promptly clarify media reports that could impact share price movements
- Maintain robust mechanisms for disclosure obligations compliance
