## Impact Assessment

This preferential allotment represents a significant capital raise for Centrum Capital Limited. The issuance of over 4.35 crore new shares at Rs. 34.38 per share will result in equity dilution for existing shareholders. The 18-month lock-in period (from allotment date) ensures that non-promoter allottees cannot immediately exit, providing stability to the stock. Market impact is expected to be moderate as the shares rank pari-passu with existing shares and trading members have been informed in advance of the listing date.
