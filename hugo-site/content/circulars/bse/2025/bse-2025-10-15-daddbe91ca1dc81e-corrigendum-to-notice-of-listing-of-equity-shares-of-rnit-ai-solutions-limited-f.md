## Important Dates

- **October 14, 2025**: Company submitted request for revised listing date
- **October 14, 2025**: Original notices issued (20251014-23 and 20251014-24)
- **October 15, 2025**: Corrigendum notice issued

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The revision delays the listing commencement for RNIT AI Solutions Limited, affecting traders and investors planning to trade the stock. The Trade-to-Trade segment classification limits intraday trading and requires delivery-based settlement, which impacts liquidity and trading strategies.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and inform clients about the revised listing date. The XT Group classification and T2T segment restrictions require specific operational handling compared to regular equity trading.

**Investor Impact**: Investors awaiting the listing must adjust their trading plans by approximately 10 days (from the original date to October 24, 2025). The T2T segment requirement means all trades must result in delivery, affecting short-term trading strategies.
