## Summary

Sprayking Ltd (Scrip Code: 540079) has announced the sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of face value Rs.2/- will be sub-divided into two equity shares of face value Re.1/- each, effective from August 12, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Sprayking Ltd (Scrip Code: 540079)
- Record date: August 12, 2025
- Sub-division ratio: 1 share of Rs.2/- into 2 shares of Re.1/- each
- Current ISIN INE537U01029 (Rs.2/- paid up) will become invalid from August 12, 2025
- New ISIN for Re.1/- paid up shares will be communicated separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE537U01029 for Rs.2/- paid up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after August 12, 2025. A new ISIN number for the Re.1/- paid up shares will be assigned and communicated to the market through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed of this corporate action and must ensure compliance with the new share structure and ISIN changes effective from the record date.

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: August 12, 2025
- **Effective Date**: August 12, 2025
- **Notice Date**: July 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This is a standard corporate action that will double the number of shares while halving the face value per share. Existing shareholders will receive two shares of Re.1/- each for every share of Rs.2/- held. The action requires system updates for the new ISIN and may temporarily affect trading until the new ISIN is implemented.
