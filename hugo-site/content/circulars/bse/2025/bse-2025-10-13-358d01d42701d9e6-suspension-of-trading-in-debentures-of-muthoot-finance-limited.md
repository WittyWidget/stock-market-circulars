## Summary

BSE has announced suspension of trading in three series of Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) issued by Muthoot Finance Limited. The suspension is effective from October 17, 2025, following the company's announcement of a record date of October 19, 2025 for redemption of debentures and payment of interest. Trading members are advised not to deal in these specified debentures during the suspension period.

## Key Points

- ISIN INE414G07GU4 (Code: 938246) - MFL-3-11-25-NCD
- ISIN INE414G07GX8 (Code: 938262) - MFL-3-11-25-NCD
- ISIN INE414G07HA4 (Code: 938266) - MFL-3-11-25-NCD
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- Notice issued under DR-738/2025-2026
- Circular issued by Assistant Vice President â€“ Listing Operations (CRD)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard corporate action notice related to debenture redemption and interest payment procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from October 17, 2025
- Trading members are required to take note of the suspension and comply with the no-dealings directive
- Members should inform their clients holding or interested in these specific debentures about the trading suspension

## Important Dates

- **October 13, 2025**: Circular issued by BSE
- **October 17, 2025**: Trading suspension begins (no dealings from this date)
- **October 19, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited and temporary. The suspension affects only three specific debenture series of Muthoot Finance Limited in the debt segment. Equity trading and other debt instruments remain unaffected.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders of the affected series will receive redemption proceeds and interest payments based on holdings as of the record date. Investors cannot trade these specific debentures during the suspension period.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to block trading in the three specified ISINs from October 17, 2025. Standard corporate action processing for debenture redemption will follow.
