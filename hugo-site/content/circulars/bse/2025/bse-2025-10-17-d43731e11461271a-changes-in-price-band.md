title: Changes in Price Band for 43 Securities Effective October 20, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for 43 securities effective from October 20, 2025. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, replacing existing levels. Price bands determine the maximum percentage by which a security's price can move up or down during a trading session. This surveillance measure is typically applied to securities with higher volatility or those requiring enhanced monitoring.

## Key Points

- 43 securities will have revised price bands effective October 20, 2025
- Price band restrictions range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive)
- 5 securities have 2% price bands: Anka India Ltd, Elango Industries Ltd, Milestone Furniture Ltd
- 17 securities have 5% price bands
- 6 securities have 10% price bands
- 15 securities have 20% price bands
- Changes are part of BSE's surveillance measures
- Trading members have been notified through Notice No 20251017-53

## Regulatory Changes

This circular represents an update to existing surveillance measures. Price bands are regulatory tools used by exchanges to:
- Control excessive intra-day volatility
- Protect investors from sharp price movements
- Monitor securities under surveillance
- Ensure orderly trading

The revision indicates BSE's ongoing assessment of market conditions and individual security behavior, with tighter bands (2%-5%) suggesting heightened surveillance concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must implement revised price bands in their trading systems before October 20, 2025
- **Risk Management Systems**: Update circuit limit parameters for affected securities
- **Investor Communication**: Inform clients trading in these securities about the revised limits
- **Queries**: Contact bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 17, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 20, 2025
- **Notice Number**: 20251017-53

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The revised price bands will limit intra-day price movements for 43 securities, potentially reducing trading volumes and liquidity in these scrips. Securities with tighter bands (2%-5%) will experience more restricted price discovery.

**Investor Impact**: Traders and investors in these securities will face limited intra-day price movements, which may affect short-term trading strategies, stop-loss orders, and volatility-based strategies. Day traders may find reduced opportunities in securities with 2%-5% bands.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their risk management systems, order management platforms, and client alerts to reflect the new price bands. Failure to update systems could result in order rejections.

**Surveillance Context**: The application or tightening of price bands often indicates exchange concerns about volatility, price manipulation, or other surveillance issues. Investors should exercise additional caution when trading these securities.
