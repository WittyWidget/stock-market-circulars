## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine debt market operation for government securities. Treasury Bill auctions are standard monetary policy tools and do not directly affect equity markets or listed companies.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Only affects trading members and investors who wish to participate in the non-competitive bidding for government securities. The facility is optional and provides an alternative channel to primary dealers for T-Bill investment.

**Investor Impact**: Provides retail and institutional investors access to government securities through the non-competitive route, allowing participation without competing with primary dealers. Maximum investment caps ensure broad participation.
