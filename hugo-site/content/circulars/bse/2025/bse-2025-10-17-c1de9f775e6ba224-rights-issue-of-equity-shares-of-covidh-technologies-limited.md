## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Extremely high dilution potential with a 25:1 rights ratio. Existing shareholders who do not participate in the rights issue will face significant dilution of their ownership stake (approximately 96% dilution if they don't subscribe).

**Market Impact**: The ex-rights trading will result in price adjustment to reflect the rights entitlement. The theoretical ex-rights price will be significantly lower than the cum-rights price given the substantial dilution factor.

**Liquidity Impact**: The large number of new shares (25x the existing base) will substantially increase the company's equity base and may impact trading patterns and liquidity post-issue.

**Financial Impact**: The company is raising capital at par value, suggesting potential fundraising for expansion, debt reduction, or working capital requirements. The at-par pricing indicates no premium, which may reflect the company's current market position or strategic pricing for maximum participation.
