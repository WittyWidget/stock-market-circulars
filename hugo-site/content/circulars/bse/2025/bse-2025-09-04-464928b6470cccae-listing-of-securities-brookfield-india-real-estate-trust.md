## Impact Assessment

The preferential allotment increases the total unit base of Brookfield India REIT, potentially diluting existing unitholders' stakes. The one-year lock-in period provides stability by preventing immediate selling pressure from new allottees. The issue price of Rs. 310 per unit will serve as a reference point for market valuation.
