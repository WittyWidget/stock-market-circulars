## Summary

India Glycols Ltd has announced the sub-division of its equity shares, splitting each existing share of Rs.10 face value into two shares of Rs.5 face value each. The record date for this corporate action is set for August 12, 2025, with the new structure becoming effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: India Glycols Ltd (Scrip Code: 500201)
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Split Ratio: 1:2 (One share of Rs.10 becomes two shares of Rs.5)
- Record Date: August 12, 2025
- Effective Date: August 12, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE560A01015) will become invalid for trading from August 12, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs.5 paid-up shares to be announced separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE560A01015 for Rs.10 paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after August 12, 2025. A new ISIN number for the Rs.5 paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date and ensure compliance with the new share structure
- All transactions must use the new ISIN number from August 12, 2025 onwards
- Members should await separate notification for the new ISIN number

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: August 12, 2025
- **Effective Date**: August 12, 2025
- **ISIN Validity Cut-off**: August 12, 2025 (old ISIN becomes invalid)

## Impact Assessment

This sub-division will increase the number of shares outstanding while reducing the face value per share, making shares more affordable for retail investors. The action requires system updates for the new ISIN and may temporarily affect trading liquidity during the transition period.
