## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders of the specific debenture series (LTMRH-9.81%-2-11-35-PVT). The 9.81% coupon rate debentures maturing in 2035 will be redeemed, affecting investors who will need to redeploy capital.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to block trading in these debentures. Investors holding these securities will receive redemption proceeds as per the terms of issuance.
