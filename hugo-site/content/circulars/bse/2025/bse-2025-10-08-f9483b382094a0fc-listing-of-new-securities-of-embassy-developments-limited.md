## Key Points

- **Number of Shares**: 53,80,500 equity shares of Rs. 2/- face value each
- **Issue Price**: Rs. 111.51 per share (including premium of Rs. 109.51)
- **Allotment Basis**: Preferential allotment to promoters pursuant to warrant conversion
- **Distinctive Numbers**: 1538989704 to 1544370203
- **ISIN**: INE069I01010
- **Ranking**: Pari-passu with existing equity shares
- **Trading Commencement**: October 9, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing procedure following preferential allotment regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the new securities for trading purposes
- Lock-in requirements must be observed for the allotted shares

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment**: August 20, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: October 9, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: April 8, 2025 (Note: This appears to be a clerical error in the original circular as the lock-in date precedes the allotment date. It should likely be April 8, 2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of preferential shares issued to promoters through warrant conversion. The shares are subject to lock-in restrictions, limiting immediate market supply. The allotment increases the paid-up capital of Embassy Developments Limited by approximately 53.8 lakh shares, which may have minimal dilution impact depending on the existing share capital.
