## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Multiple large-cap companies involved affecting SLB trading volumes during shut periods. The bonus issue from Nestle India is particularly significant as it will affect share count and pricing.

**Operational Impact**: SLB participants need to plan around multiple shut periods in August 2025. The concentration of corporate actions may reduce available securities for lending/borrowing temporarily.

**Trading Impact**: Reduced liquidity in SLB segment during shut periods. Price adjustments expected post ex-dates, particularly for Nestle India due to bonus issue.
