## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the resumption of trading from August 14, 2025
- Trading members must recognize the reduced face value of Rs. 82,500 per debenture
- All trading activities must comply with the new face value structure

## Important Dates

- **August 14, 2025**: Trading resumption date with reduced face value

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact limited to holders of ASCEND TELECOM INFRASTRUCTURE PVT LTD debentures. The part redemption reduces the outstanding principal amount, affecting the face value and potentially the trading dynamics of these debt securities. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value for proper settlement and trading operations.
