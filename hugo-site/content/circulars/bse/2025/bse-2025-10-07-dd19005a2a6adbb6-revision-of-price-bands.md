title: Revision of Price Bands - Circuit Filter Changes for Multiple Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the circuit filter percentage to 2% for multiple securities effective from the date specified in the circular. Circuit filters are price bands that limit the maximum price movement (up or down) that a security can experience during a trading session. This revision applies to over 70 securities across various sectors.

## Key Points

- Circuit filter revised to 2% for all listed securities in this circular
- Affects securities across diverse sectors including pharmaceuticals, infrastructure, technology, real estate, and manufacturing
- Includes companies like A2Z Infra Engineering Ltd, Aarey Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Ansal Properties & Infrastructure Ltd, and many others
- The 2% circuit filter is typically applied to securities under enhanced surveillance or with higher volatility concerns
- Complete list includes scrip codes, ISIN numbers, and company names for easy identification

## Regulatory Changes

The circuit filter mechanism has been adjusted from previous levels to 2% for the specified securities. Circuit filters are a market surveillance tool used by exchanges to:

- Control excessive volatility in individual securities
- Prevent manipulation and extreme price movements
- Provide cooling-off periods during unusual market activity
- Protect investor interests

A 2% circuit filter means trading will be halted if the security's price moves up or down by 2% from the previous closing price during the trading session.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Trading Members**: Must ensure their systems are updated with the new circuit filter limits
- **Market Participants**: Should be aware of the revised price bands when placing orders
- **Risk Management Systems**: Need to incorporate the updated circuit filter percentages
- **Investors**: Should factor in the 2% daily movement limit when planning trades in these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: As specified in the circular (October 7, 2025 or next trading session)
- **Implementation**: Immediate upon notification

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: 
- Limited intraday price movement to Â±2% for affected securities
- May reduce trading volumes in these securities due to tighter price bands
- Could increase trading halts if securities hit circuit limits

**Trading Impact**:
- Day traders and short-term traders will face more restrictive price movement constraints
- Reduced volatility may impact options and derivatives strategies
- Price discovery may be affected due to frequent circuit breakers

**Investor Impact**:
- Provides downside protection by limiting maximum loss to 2% per session
- May create liquidity issues if securities repeatedly hit circuit limits
- Long-term investors less affected compared to active traders

**Operational Impact**:
- Brokers need to update risk management systems
- Algorithmic trading systems require recalibration
- Increased monitoring required for securities approaching circuit limits
