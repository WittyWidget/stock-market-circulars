title: Price Band Revisions for 10 Scrips Effective October 21, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for 10 equity scrips effective from October 21, 2025. The price bands range from 2% to 10%, representing changes from their existing levels. Price bands are implemented as surveillance measures to control excessive volatility in securities.

## Key Points

- 10 scrips will have revised price bands effective October 21, 2025
- Price bands vary from 2% to 10% depending on the security
- Three scrips (GDL Leasing & Finance Ltd, Prima Industries Ltd, VR Woodart Ltd) have the tightest 2% price band
- Four scrips have 5% price bands: Chartered Capital & Investment Ltd, LKP Finance Ltd, Sailani Tours N Travels Ltd, SEL Manufacturing Company Ltd
- Three scrips have 10% price bands: Envair Electrodyne Ltd, Hybrid Financial Services Ltd, Nureca Ltd
- Trading members can contact bse.surv@bseindia.com for clarifications

## Regulatory Changes

Price band modifications are implemented as part of BSE's surveillance framework to regulate trading volatility. The revised price bands will limit the maximum price movement (both upward and downward) that these scrips can experience in a single trading session.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised price bands for the affected scrips
- Orders placed for these securities must comply with the new price band limits from October 21, 2025
- Risk management systems should be updated to reflect the new price bands

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 20, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 21, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The tighter price bands will restrict intraday volatility for the affected scrips. Securities with 2% price bands will experience the most stringent trading restrictions, potentially affecting liquidity and trading volumes. The 10% price band scrips will have relatively more flexibility in price movement.

**Trading Impact**: Traders and investors in these securities need to adjust their strategies considering the revised price movement limits. Stop-loss orders and intraday trading strategies may need to be recalibrated based on the new price bands.
