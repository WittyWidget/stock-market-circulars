**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium - While the name change itself does not alter operations, it may indicate broader organizational restructuring. Existing contracts and legal obligations remain unaffected.

**Investor Impact**: Medium - Shareholders should note that this is a name change only and does not affect shareholding rights, equity structure, or liabilities. However, investors should monitor for any subsequent announcements regarding business demerger or restructuring that this name change may precede.

**Brand Impact**: High - Significant rebranding exercise required across all touchpoints including signage, documentation, marketing materials, and digital presence over the two-year transition period.
