## Impact Assessment

This bulletin has limited market-wide impact as it primarily affects holders of specific securities. The interim dividend from Elecon Engineering may attract investor interest in that equity security. The multiple NCD interest payments and partial redemption provide routine cash flows to debt security holders. Investors in the listed securities should note the record dates to ensure entitlement to the announced corporate actions.
