## Summary

BSE received clarifications from two companies regarding significant increases in their trading volumes. Aadhar Housing Finance Limited provided detailed explanation about an open offer by Blackstone entities, while Sudarshan Chemical Industries Limited's response appears incomplete in the provided content.

## Key Points

- Aadhar Housing Finance (Scrip Code: 544176) clarified volume increase due to open offer announcement
- BCP Asia II Holdco VII Pte. Ltd. and Blackstone entities making open offer for Aadhar Housing Finance shares
- Open offer price not exceeding Rs. 425.00 per equity share for up to 28,20,52,121 shares (64.14% of Expanded Voting Share Capital)
- Share purchase agreement executed on July 25, 2025
- Companies confirmed compliance with SEBI Listing Regulations regarding price sensitive information disclosure
- Sudarshan Chemical Industries (Scrip Code: 506655, NSE Symbol: SUDARSCHEM) also provided clarification but content appears truncated

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. Companies reaffirmed compliance with existing SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosures Requirements) Regulations, 2015 and SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must provide timely clarifications when BSE requests explanation for unusual trading activity
- Mandatory disclosure under Regulation 30 for price sensitive information
- Open offer compliance requirements under SEBI Takeover Regulations
- Ongoing disclosure obligations for material developments

## Important Dates

- July 25, 2025: Share purchase agreement execution date for Aadhar Housing Finance
- July 25, 2025: Disclosure of unaudited financial results for Q1 FY2026 by Aadhar Housing Finance

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact event primarily affecting Aadhar Housing Finance shareholders due to the significant open offer by Blackstone entities. The open offer at Rs. 425 per share for majority stake acquisition represents a major corporate development. Trading volume increases were appropriately explained through proper regulatory disclosures, indicating transparent market operations.
