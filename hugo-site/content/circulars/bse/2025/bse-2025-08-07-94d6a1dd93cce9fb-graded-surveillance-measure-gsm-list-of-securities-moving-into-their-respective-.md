title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - List of securities moving into their respective
  GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework by moving three securities to different GSM stages. This surveillance measure is designed to enhance monitoring of securities that exhibit unusual price movements or trading patterns.

## Key Points

- Three securities are being moved to higher GSM stages for enhanced surveillance
- Prashant India Ltd. moved to GSM Stage II
- India Radiators Ltd. and Aar Shyam India Investment Company Limited moved to GSM Stage III
- Securities marked with special symbols may have different treatment due to ESM or IBC framework inclusion

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework provides a structured approach to surveillance with different stages having varying levels of monitoring and trading restrictions. Higher stages typically involve more stringent surveillance measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members and investors should be aware of the enhanced surveillance measures applicable to these securities
- Additional due diligence may be required when trading in GSM securities
- Compliance with any additional reporting or disclosure requirements as per GSM framework

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: August 7, 2025
- Notification Date: August 7, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The movement to higher GSM stages may result in increased scrutiny of trading activities in these securities. This could lead to reduced liquidity and increased volatility as market participants adjust to the enhanced surveillance measures. Investors should exercise additional caution when trading in these securities.
