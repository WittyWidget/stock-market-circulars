## Important Dates

- **October 17, 2025**: Circular notification date
- **October 24, 2025**: Record date for rights issue eligibility
- **October 24, 2025**: Ex-rights trading begins
- **Settlement DR-742/2025-2026**: Applicable settlement period

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The 25:1 rights ratio represents a highly dilutive corporate action that will significantly increase the company's equity base. This is an unusually high rights ratio that could substantially impact the stock price when trading begins on an ex-rights basis.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will have the opportunity to subscribe to 25 new shares for each share held, maintaining their proportional ownership if they fully subscribe. Non-participation will result in significant dilution of shareholding percentage.

**Trading Impact**: From October 24, 2025, all trades will be executed on an ex-rights basis, meaning buyers will not be entitled to participate in the rights issue. Stock price is expected to adjust downward to reflect the ex-rights status.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reflect the ex-rights status and ensure proper settlement under DR-742/2025-2026.
