## Key Points

- **Merging Scheme**: Edelweiss CRISIL PSU Plus SDL 50:50 Oct 2025 Index Fund (open-ended target maturity index fund investing in CRISIL [IBX] 50:50 PSU + SDL Index â€“ October 2025)
- **Transferee Scheme**: Edelweiss Banking and PSU Debt Fund (open-ended debt scheme investing in debt instruments of banks, PSUs, public financial institutions, and municipal bonds)
- **Effective Date**: October 31, 2025 (or next business day if non-business day)
- **Consent/Exit Period**: September 30, 2025 to October 29, 2025 (both days inclusive)
- **Credit Quality**: Merging scheme has ~50% in AAA-rated CPSE bonds and remaining in SDLs; Transferee scheme has ~78% in AAA-rated CPSE bonds and AAA-rated banks

## Impact Assessment

**Rationale for Merger:**

1. **Comparable Credit Quality**: Both schemes maintain high credit standards with AAA-rated exposures and government securities
2. **Improved Liquidity**: Transferee scheme offers superior liquidity through exposure to more liquid CPSE bonds and government bonds
3. **Reinvestment Risk Mitigation**: Merger eliminates reinvestment risk associated with target maturity fund's fixed maturity date
4. **Active Management Benefits**: Investors gain from active duration management based on market conditions
5. **Enhanced Diversification**: Broader portfolio with diversified exposure across AAA-rated CPSE bonds, bank bonds, and various maturity buckets
6. **Tax Efficiency**: Continuing investors maintain tax efficiency as merger does not trigger capital gains under section 47(xviii) of Income Tax Act 1961

**Impact on Investors:**
- Unit holders of merging scheme must decide whether to consent to merger or exit during option period
- Those consenting will receive units in transferee scheme without tax implications
- Portfolio shifts from target maturity structure to open-ended active management approach
- Credit profile remains strong with potential liquidity improvements
