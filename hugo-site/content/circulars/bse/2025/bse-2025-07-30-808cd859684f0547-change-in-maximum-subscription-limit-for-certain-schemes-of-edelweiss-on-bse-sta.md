title: Edelweiss Greater China Equity Off-Shore Fund Subscription Limit Increased
  to INR 25 Lakh per PAN
---

## Summary

Edelweiss Asset Management Limited has increased the daily subscription limit for Edelweiss Greater China Equity Off-Shore Fund from INR 10 lakh to INR 25 lakh per PAN per day, effective July 31, 2025. This change is based on available headroom for overseas investment limits set at the mutual fund level as of February 1, 2022.

## Key Points

- Daily subscription limit increased from INR 10 lakh to INR 25 lakh per PAN
- Applies to lump sum, switch-in, SIP, and STP transactions
- Based on transaction reporting date
- Existing systematic transactions (SIPs/STPs) remain unaffected
- Other offshore funds maintain INR 10 lakh per PAN per day limit
- Changes will be incorporated in SID/KIM documents

## Regulatory Changes

The increase follows SEBI clarification dated June 17, 2022 (SEBI/HO/OW/IMD-II/DOF3/25095/2022) allowing mutual funds to resume subscriptions and investments in overseas securities up to available headroom without breaching overseas investment limits.

## Compliance Requirements

- Mutual fund to update Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)
- Notice-cum-addendum forms integral part of scheme documents
- Investors must read all scheme related documents carefully

## Important Dates

- **July 31, 2025**: Revised subscription limit becomes effective
- **July 30, 2025**: Cut-off date for transactions under old limit
- **July 28, 2025**: Notice issued date

## Impact Assessment

The increased subscription limit provides greater investment access for investors in the Greater China Equity Off-Shore Fund, potentially increasing fund inflows. The change is specific to one scheme and does not affect other offshore funds, indicating targeted approach based on available overseas investment headroom.
