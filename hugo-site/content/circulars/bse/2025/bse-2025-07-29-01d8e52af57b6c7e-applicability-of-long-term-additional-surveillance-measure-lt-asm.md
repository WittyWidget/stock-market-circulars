## Summary

BSE has issued an update on the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective July 30, 2025. Three securities have been newly shortlisted under the LT-ASM framework: Gujarat Hy-Spin Ltd, Sterlite Technologies Ltd, and Times Guaranty Ltd. No securities are moving between ASM stages or exiting the framework.

## Key Points

- 3 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages
- No securities moving out of LT-ASM Framework
- Consolidated list shows securities across different ASM stages (I, II, III, IV)
- Framework includes provisions for securities under various other frameworks (Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, IBC)

## Regulatory Changes

The LT-ASM framework continues with standard surveillance measures. Securities under this framework are subject to additional monitoring and trading restrictions to ensure market stability and investor protection.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with surveillance measures for listed securities
- Enhanced monitoring requirements for securities under LT-ASM
- Adherence to stage-specific trading restrictions

## Important Dates
