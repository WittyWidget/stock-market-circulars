## Summary

BSE has announced the Market Wide Position Limits (MWPL) for stocks traded under Securities Lending and Borrowing Scheme (SLBS) for August 2025. The circular provides position limits at three levels: market wide, client level, and limits for clearing members and institutional investors.

## Key Points

- Position limits specified for 45+ securities including ETFs and equity shares
- Three-tiered limit structure: Market Wide, Client Level, and CM/Institutional Investor levels
- Limits range from as low as 164,859 shares (HDFCGROWTH) to as high as 180,842,473 shares (Easy Trip Planners)
- Covers major ETFs including banking, PSU, technology, and infrastructure themed funds
- Includes newly listed companies like Mankind Pharma, NMDC Steel, and KFin Technologies

## Regulatory Changes

This represents the monthly update of position limits for SLBS trading, ensuring appropriate risk management and market stability in securities lending activities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must adhere to specified position limits for each security
- Clearing members and institutional investors have separate higher limits compared to regular clients
- Position monitoring and compliance with limits is mandatory for all SLBS participants

## Important Dates

- Effective: August 2025
