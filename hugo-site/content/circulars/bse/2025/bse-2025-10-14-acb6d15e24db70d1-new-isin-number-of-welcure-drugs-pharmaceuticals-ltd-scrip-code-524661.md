## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division from Rs.10 to Re.1 (1:10 split) will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while reducing the trading price proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market participants must ensure their systems are updated with the new ISIN number before the ex-date to avoid trade execution issues. Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held, improving marketability of the stock.
