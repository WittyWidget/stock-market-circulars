title: Change in NFO Allotment Date of MAGNUM HYBRID LONG SHORT FUND on BSE StAR MF
  Platform
---

## Summary

BSE has notified members of a change in the tentative allotment date for MAGNUM HYBRID LONG SHORT FUND (SIF) NFO by SBI Mutual Fund. The allotment date has been advanced from October 23, 2025 to October 20, 2025. The NFO period has been extended till midnight on October 15, 2025 on BSE StAR MF Platform. Clear funds must be available in ICCL Account by 6:00 PM on October 20, 2025 for allotment.

## Key Points

- Allotment date revised from October 23, 2025 to October 20, 2025
- NFO extended till midnight on October 15, 2025
- Transactions without client-initiated funds by 9:00 AM on T+1 day will be cancelled
- Transactions with initiated payment remain pending till 3:00 PM on last payout day or T+5, whichever is earlier
- Clear funds must be in ICCL Account by 6:00 PM on October 20, 2025
- Cheques and OTM payments acceptable subject to clear funds receipt by deadline
- Switches accepted during NFO period subject to fund receipt on or before allotment date
- Cancelled transactions will be reported to RTA/AMC with CC and N flag

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational modification to previously announced NFO schedule (Notice No. 20250930-70 dated September 30, 2025).

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must ensure clients initiate funds by 9:00 AM on T+1 day to avoid cancellation
- Clear funds must be available in ICCL Account by 6:00 PM on October 20, 2025
- For switch transactions, funds must be received on or before allotment date for NFO scheme consideration
- Members must inform clients about revised allotment date and fund payment deadlines

## Important Dates

- **October 15, 2025 (Midnight)**: Extended NFO closing date
- **October 20, 2025 (6:00 PM)**: Deadline for clear funds in ICCL Account
- **October 20, 2025**: Revised tentative allotment date (changed from October 23, 2025)
- **T+1 Day (9:00 AM)**: Deadline for client fund initiation to avoid cancellation
- **T+5 or Last Payout Day (3:00 PM)**: Pending transaction deadline (whichever is earlier)

## Impact Assessment

The advancement of allotment date by three days requires members and investors to expedite fund arrangements. Members with pending NFO transactions must ensure client payments are initiated and cleared earlier than originally scheduled. The extended NFO period till October 15 midnight provides additional subscription time, but the compressed settlement timeline (funds required by October 20 at 6:00 PM) may create operational challenges. Switch transactions face stricter timelines as funds must be received before allotment date. Members need to proactively communicate these changes to avoid transaction cancellations and ensure successful NFO participation.
