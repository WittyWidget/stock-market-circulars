## Impact Assessment

**Rationale for Merger:**

The merger is driven by significant changes in the interest rate environment and liquidity conditions:

1. **Interest Rate Cuts**: RBI reduced rates by cumulative 100 bps in 6 months (25 bps in February 2025, 25 bps in April 2025, and 50 bps in June 2025)

2. **Liquidity Measures**: In February 2025, RBI executed substantial liquidity injection and enhanced bond purchases to address interbank cash shortages

3. **Market Impact**: Interest rate cuts and liquidity injections pushed bond yields lower, leading to limited investor interest in Debt Index Funds

4. **Operational Challenges**: 
   - Sustained redemptions from the Merging Scheme
   - Continuous outflows and decreasing AUM
   - Lower AUM making it challenging to replicate the underlying index
   - Difficulty in maintaining tracking difference requirements per regulatory guidelines

**Impact on Unitholders:**

- Unitholders will transition from a target maturity index fund (focused on AAA Financial Services bonds maturing by December 2026) to a broader corporate bond fund with diversified investment mandate
- The Surviving Scheme offers greater flexibility in asset allocation across debt and money market instruments
- Merger is positioned as being in the interest of unitholders given operational constraints of the Merging Scheme
