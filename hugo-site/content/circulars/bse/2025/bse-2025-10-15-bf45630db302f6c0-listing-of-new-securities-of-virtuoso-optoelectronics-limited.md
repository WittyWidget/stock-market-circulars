## Summary

BSE has approved the listing and trading of 8,79,121 new equity shares of Virtuoso Optoelectronics Limited (Scrip Code: 543597) with effect from October 16, 2025. These shares were issued to non-promoters on a preferential basis pursuant to the conversion of warrants at an issue price of Rs. 455 per share (face value Rs. 10 with premium of Rs. 445). The shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares and are subject to a lock-in period.

## Key Points

- 8,79,121 equity shares of Rs. 10 each issued at Rs. 455 per share (including premium of Rs. 445)
- Issued to non-promoters on preferential basis pursuant to warrant conversion
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares
- Trading commences on October 16, 2025
- ISIN: INE0I0T01010
- Distinctive Numbers: 29488757 to 30367877
- Date of Allotment: September 23, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced by this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are informed to note the listing and permit trading of these securities from October 16, 2025. The lock-in restrictions must be observed as per the specified terms.

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: September 23, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: October 16, 2025
- **Lock-in Period Ends**: May 30, 2026 (for all 8,79,121 shares)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment represents a relatively small issuance to non-promoters through warrant conversion. The lock-in period until May 30, 2026 ensures these shares cannot be immediately traded by allottees, preventing sudden supply increase. The pari-passu ranking maintains equal rights for all shareholders. Overall impact on trading activity and stock price is expected to be limited.
