**Investor Impact**: Relevant only for institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals participating in the debt market. The high minimum denomination (Rs. 5 lakhs) limits retail participation.

**Operational Impact**: Standard operational procedures apply. Trading members have clear guidelines for trading denomination, tick size, and settlement processes.
