## Summary

Chandrima Mercantiles Ltd (Scrip Code: 540829) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of Rs.10 will be divided into ten equity shares of Re.1 each, with the record date set for August 20, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Chandrima Mercantiles Ltd (Scrip Code: 540829)
- Sub-division ratio: 1 share of Rs.10 becomes 10 shares of Re.1 each
- Record date: August 20, 2025
- Effective date: August 20, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE371F01016) will become invalid for trading from August 20, 2025
- New ISIN for Re.1 paid-up shares to be announced separately

## Regulatory Changes

- The existing ISIN No. INE371F01016 for Rs.10 paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions from August 20, 2025
- A new ISIN number for Re.1 paid-up shares will be issued and communicated through separate notice

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date for sub-division purposes
- All transactions must comply with the new share structure from the effective date
- Market participants should await the new ISIN announcement for Re.1 shares

## Important Dates

- Record Date: August 20, 2025
- Effective Date: August 20, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action that will increase the number of shares outstanding while reducing the face value proportionally. Existing shareholders will receive 10 new shares for each share held. The sub-division may improve liquidity by making shares more affordable for retail investors. Market participants need to update their systems for the new ISIN once announced.
