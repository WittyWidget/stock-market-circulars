## Impact Assessment

This circular has limited market impact as it affects only holders of MONEYBOXX FINANCE LIMITED's specific non-convertible debenture series (MFL-12%-11-11-26-PVT). The part redemption will reduce the outstanding face value per debenture to Rs. 5,000, and existing debenture holders will receive interest payment along with partial principal repayment. Trading members need to ensure their systems reflect the reduced face value from the effective date to ensure accurate settlement.
