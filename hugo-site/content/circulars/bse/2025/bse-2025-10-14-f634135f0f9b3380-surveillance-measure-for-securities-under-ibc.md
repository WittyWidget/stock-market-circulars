Effective October 15, 2025, Carnation Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 530609, ISIN: INE081B01028) has been added to Stage 1 of Additional Surveillance Measure. No securities are being moved to Stage 0, between stages, or excluded from ASM framework.

- No securities moved from Stage 1 to Stage 2 or Stage 2 to Stage 1
- No securities excluded from ASM for IBC framework

## Regulatory Changes

The surveillance framework continues to operate under existing IBC guidelines with staged surveillance measures:

- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company
- **Stage 1**: Additional Surveillance Measure for companies in Insolvency Resolution Process
- **Stage 2**: Higher level of surveillance for IBC companies

Special notations apply:
- (*) indicates securities as per NSE
- (~) denotes T+0 scrips shortlisted in IBC framework as per parent company
- (^) marks recommencement scrips

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the updated surveillance status of Carnation Industries Ltd
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in securities under IBC surveillance
- Investors should be aware of heightened risks associated with securities under insolvency proceedings
- Market participants must follow ASM framework guidelines for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 15, 2025 - Carnation Industries Ltd moves to IBC Stage 1
- **Circular Date**: October 14, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Carnation Industries Ltd will face additional surveillance measures including potential price bands, trading restrictions, or enhanced margin requirements under Stage 1 ASM framework.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading Carnation Industries Ltd should exercise increased caution due to the company's insolvency proceedings. The stock may experience reduced liquidity and higher volatility.

**Market Impact**: Limited broader market impact as only one security is being added to surveillance. The consolidated list shows multiple securities already under IBC surveillance across various stages, indicating this is part of ongoing regulatory oversight of companies in financial distress.
