## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notice with minimal market impact. The small volume of 5,631 shares represents a minor addition to the company's equity base. The preferential allotment to non-promoters via warrant conversion follows standard regulatory procedures. The 18-month lock-in period (from allotment to April 2026) prevents immediate trading of these shares, further limiting any short-term market impact. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the expanded share capital and lock-in restrictions.
