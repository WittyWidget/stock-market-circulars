## Summary

## Key Points

- Share subdivision from Rs. 5/- to Rs. 2/- per share
- Record date: August 21, 2025
- Effective date: August 21, 2025
- Current ISIN INE060X01026 will be invalid from August 21, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE060X01026 of Rs. 5/- paid up will not be valid for transactions on the Exchange on or after August 21, 2025. A new ISIN number for Rs. 2/- paid up shares will be communicated through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the subdivision and ensure transactions are conducted with the correct ISIN after the effective date. All stakeholders should be aware of the change in share denomination and corresponding ISIN.
