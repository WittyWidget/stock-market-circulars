title: BSE Revises Enhanced Surveillance Measure Framework with Stricter Price Variation
  Criteria
---

## Summary

BSE has announced a comprehensive revision to its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework, introducing stricter shortlisting criteria based on high-low and close-to-close price variations. The revised framework establishes a two-stage surveillance system with escalating restrictions including 100% margins, trade-for-trade settlement, reduced price bands, and periodic call auction mechanisms for qualifying securities.

## Key Points

- New shortlisting criteria based on standard deviation of price variations for companies with market cap less than ₹1000 crores
- Two-stage surveillance system with progressive restrictions
- Securities with derivative products excluded from ESM shortlisting
- Stage I: 100% margin and trade-for-trade with 5% (or 2%) price band
- Stage II: 100% margin with 2% price band under periodic call auction
- Weekly review process for stage revision and exit
- Minimum retention period of 90 calendar days in framework

## Regulatory Changes

**Shortlisting Criteria (Stage 1):**
- High-Low price variation thresholds: 75% (3 months), 100% (6 months), 150% (12 months)
- Close-to-Close price variation thresholds: 50% (3 months), 75% (6 months), 100% (12 months)
- Must meet 1 standard deviation criterion for respective company category
- Requires positive close-to-close variation over last three months

**Stage II Entry Conditions:**
- 5 consecutive trading days with ≥15% close-to-close variation, OR
- Monthly close-to-close variation ≥30%
- PE ratio ≤0 or >2 times BSE 500 benchmark PE

## Compliance Requirements

**For Stage I Securities:**
- 100% margin applicable from T+2 day
- Trade-for-trade settlement mandatory
- Price band restriction to 5% (or 2% if already in 2% band)

**For Stage II Securities:**
- 100% margin requirement continues
- Trading restricted to ±2% price band
- All trading under Periodic Call Auction mechanism

**Market Participants:**
- Must comply with enhanced margin requirements
- Adhere to restricted trading mechanisms for ESM securities

## Important Dates

- **Implementation**: Framework effective from circular date
- **Review Frequency**: Weekly basis for stage revision and exit
- **Minimum Retention**: 90 calendar days in ESM framework
- **Stage II Minimum**: 1 month retention before potential downgrade to Stage I

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Increased surveillance on volatile small and mid-cap securities
- Enhanced margin requirements may reduce speculative trading
- Trade-for-trade settlement reduces liquidity for affected securities
- Periodic call auction mechanism significantly limits trading flexibility

**Operational Impact:**
- Brokers must implement enhanced margin collection systems
- Trading systems require updates for new price band restrictions
- Compliance monitoring systems need alignment with revised criteria
- Investor education required on new framework implications

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Stronger controls on price manipulation and excessive volatility
- Protection for retail investors through enhanced surveillance
- Systematic approach to identifying and monitoring high-risk securities
