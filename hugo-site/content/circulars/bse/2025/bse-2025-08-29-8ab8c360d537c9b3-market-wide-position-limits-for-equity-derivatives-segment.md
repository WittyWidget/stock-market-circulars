title: Market Wide Position Limits for Equity Derivatives Segment
---

## Summary

BSE has published the market wide position limits for equity derivatives segment covering 67 securities. The circular specifies position limits for Trading Members (TM), Foreign Institutional Investors (FII), Mutual Funds (MF), and Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) Category I/II across different categories including market wide limits, non-promoter holdings limits, overall stock limits, and stock futures limits.

## Key Points

- Position limits specified for 67 securities including major blue-chip stocks
- Separate limits defined for different participant categories (TM, FII, MF, FPI Category I/II)
- Four types of limits: Market Wide Limit, 1% of non-promoter holdings, Overall Stock Limit, and Stock Futures Limit
- Covers major stocks like 360 ONE WAM, ABB India, Aditya Birla Capital, Adani group companies, Asian Paints, Bajaj group companies, major banks, and pharmaceutical companies
- Position limits range from hundreds of thousands to millions of shares depending on the security

## Regulatory Changes

This appears to be a periodic update of position limits for equity derivatives trading. The limits are set based on market capitalization, liquidity, and non-promoter holdings of individual securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members, FIIs, Mutual Funds, and FPIs must adhere to specified position limits for each security
- Participants must monitor their positions across all categories to ensure compliance
- Separate compliance required for stock futures and overall stock positions

## Important Dates

The circular is dated August 29, 2025, and these limits are effective immediately for equity derivatives trading.

## Impact Assessment

The position limits directly impact institutional trading strategies and risk management for equity derivatives. Large institutional investors and trading members must adjust their position sizes according to these limits. The limits help maintain market stability by preventing excessive concentration of positions in individual securities.
