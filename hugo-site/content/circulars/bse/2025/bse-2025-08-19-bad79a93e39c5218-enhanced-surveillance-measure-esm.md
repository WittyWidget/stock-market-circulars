---

## Summary

BSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective August 20, 2025, adding 3 new securities, moving 3 securities to higher ESM stages, and maintaining a consolidated list of all securities under surveillance. No securities are moving out of the framework or to lower stages.

## Key Points

- 3 securities newly added to ESM Framework: Clinitech Laboratory Ltd, Ramchandra Leasing & Finance Ltd, and Retina Paints Ltd
- 3 securities moved to higher ESM stages: Alan Scott Industries Ltd, Shree Pacetronix Ltd, and Vashu Bhagnani Industries Ltd
- No securities moving out of ESM Framework or to lower stages
- Consolidated list shows 29+ securities currently under various ESM stages
- Framework includes both main board and SME securities

## Regulatory Changes

ESM Framework continues with stage-wise surveillance measures, with securities progressing through different stages based on risk assessment criteria. The framework maintains enhanced monitoring and trading restrictions for listed securities showing unusual price movements or trading patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies under ESM must comply with enhanced disclosure requirements
- Trading members must follow additional surveillance protocols for ESM securities
- Investors should be aware of enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions
- Companies may face additional compliance obligations based on ESM stage

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 20, 2025 - All ESM changes take effect
- **Implementation**: Enhanced surveillance measures apply immediately upon effective date

## Impact Assessment

The ESM Framework updates affect trading liquidity and investor sentiment for the identified securities. Companies newly added or moved to higher stages may experience increased scrutiny and potential trading constraints. The measure aims to protect investor interests by monitoring securities with unusual trading patterns or corporate governance concerns.
