This is a routine corporate action involving preferential allotment through warrant conversion for Royal Sense Limited. The impact is limited to this specific company and its shareholders. The lock-in period until April 30, 2026 means these shares cannot be traded freely until that date, preventing immediate dilution impact. The issuance represents capital raising activity for the company.
