- Long Term ASM (LT-ASM) Framework (*)
- Trade for Trade Framework (**)
- Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) Framework (#)
- Pledge Framework (^)
- Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework ($)

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the securities under ST-ASM framework for trading purposes

- Special attention required for SME and T+0 scrips under the framework
- Securities under ST-ASM are subject to specific trading restrictions and monitoring

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 07, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework take effect
- **Circular Date**: October 06, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The changes affect 17 securities in total (9 additions, 8 removals), indicating active surveillance measures by BSE. The movement of 6 securities from ST-ASM to ESM Framework suggests escalation of surveillance for those securities. Traders and investors in these securities should be aware of applicable trading restrictions and surveillance measures. The inclusion of both main board and SME securities indicates comprehensive market monitoring across segments.
