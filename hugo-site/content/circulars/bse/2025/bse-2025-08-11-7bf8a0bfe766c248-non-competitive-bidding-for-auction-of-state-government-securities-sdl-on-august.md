## Summary

BSE announces non-competitive bidding facility for State Development Loan (SDL) securities auction scheduled for August 12, 2025. The auction includes 9 securities from various states (Bihar, Goa, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Maharashtra, Telangana) with a total issue size of Rs. 8,450 crores. Trading members can participate through BSE's iBBS web-based NCB-GSec module.

## Key Points

- 9 SDL securities available for auction totaling Rs. 8,450 crores
- Mix of new issues and re-issues from 6 different states
- Non-competitive bidding facility available through iBBS platform
- Minimum subscription units: 100 (Rs. 10,000 minimum amount)
- 24-hour bid collection window starting August 11, 2025 at 10:00 AM
- Different bid collection end times for direct investors vs members

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This circular continues the existing non-competitive bidding facility launched in November 2019 for SDL auctions conducted by RBI.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use NCB-GSec module of iBBS system for bidding
- Adherence to minimum subscription amounts and multiples
- Compliance with specified bid collection timelines
- Settlement obligations as per standard T+1 cycle

## Important Dates

- **Bid Collection Start**: August 11, 2025, 10:00 AM onwards
- **Bid Collection End (Direct Investors)**: August 11, 2025
- **Bid Collection End (Members)**: August 12, 2025, 8:00 AM
- **Auction Date**: August 12, 2025
- **Settlement Date**: August 13, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Moderate impact on debt market participants and institutional investors. The large issue size of Rs. 8,450 crores provides significant investment opportunities in state government securities. The non-competitive bidding facility enables broader participation from retail and institutional investors who may not participate in competitive auctions. Settlement and operational teams need to prepare for T+1 settlement cycle.
