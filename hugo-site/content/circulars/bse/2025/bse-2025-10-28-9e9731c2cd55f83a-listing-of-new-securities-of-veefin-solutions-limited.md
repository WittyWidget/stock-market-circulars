## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment represents a relatively small number of shares issued to promoters following warrant conversion. The lock-in period of approximately 18 months ensures these shares cannot be traded immediately, preventing any sudden supply increase in the market. Impact is limited to Veefin Solutions Limited shareholders and does not affect broader market operations or trading mechanisms.
