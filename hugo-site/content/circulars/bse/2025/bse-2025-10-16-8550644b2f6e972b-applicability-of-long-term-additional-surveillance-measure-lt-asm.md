## Regulatory Framework

The Long Term ASM framework is a surveillance measure designed to alert investors about securities showing abnormal price movements or other concerns. Securities under this framework face additional compliance requirements and trading restrictions based on their stage (I, II, III, or IV).

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 17, 2025
- All changes to surveillance classifications become applicable from this date

## Impact Assessment

**For Investors:** Investors holding securities newly added to LT-ASM or moved to higher stages should be aware of increased trading restrictions and surveillance. These securities may face additional margin requirements, price bands, or other trading limitations.

**For Listed Companies:** Companies must ensure compliance with enhanced disclosure requirements and may face reputational impact from surveillance classification.

**Market Impact:** The surveillance framework helps protect investors by identifying potentially risky securities while maintaining market integrity. Securities moving to higher stages or direct Stage IV placement indicate heightened regulatory concerns.
