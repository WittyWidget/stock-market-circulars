- Framework includes both regular and SME scrips
- Changes effective from August 7, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Securities in ST-ASM framework subject to enhanced surveillance measures
- Trading members must comply with additional monitoring requirements for affected securities
- SME scrips and T+0 scrips have specific identification markers

## Important Dates
