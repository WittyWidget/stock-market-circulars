**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium for BSE StAR MF Platform members - Members handling mutual fund transactions need to be aware of the specific timelines and payment requirements for this NFO, including the extended midnight trading period and strict fund availability deadlines. Failure to meet payment timelines will result in automatic transaction cancellation.
