- Highway Infrastructure Ltd has the highest band at 20%
- Most restrictive band of 2% applies to 11 securities

## Regulatory Changes

- 2% band: 11 securities including AGS Transact, Containerway International, Darjeeling Ropeway
- 5% band: 9 securities including Aadi Industries, Andhra Cements, BCC Fuba India
- 10% band: 4 securities including Affordable Robotic & Automation, Novateor Research

## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates

- Notice Date: August 26, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on affected securities as price bands limit daily price movement. Tighter bands (2-5%) significantly restrict trading flexibility, while the 20% band for Highway Infrastructure suggests heightened surveillance concerns. Impact primarily affects day traders and short-term investors in these specific scrips.
