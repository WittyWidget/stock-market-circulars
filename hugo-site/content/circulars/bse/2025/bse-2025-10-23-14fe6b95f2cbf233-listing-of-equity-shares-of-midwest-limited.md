## Impact Assessment

**Market Liquidity**: Approximately 91.79% of listed shares (3,31,92,697 out of 3,61,60,816) are under various lock-in periods, significantly limiting immediate tradable float. Only 29,68,119 public IPO shares and 14,08,851 AIF shares are freely tradable from listing date.

**Investor Impact**: Anchor investors face short-term restrictions (30-90 days), while promoters and strategic investors have longer lock-ins (6 months to 3 years), indicating long-term commitment.

**Compliance Impact**: Standard post-IPO compliance with no unusual restrictions. The AIF Category II exemption for 14,08,851 shares provides additional liquidity.

**Operational Impact**: Company must maintain detailed lock-in registers and ensure depository systems reflect accurate lock-in flags for restricted shares.
