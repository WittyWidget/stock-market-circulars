- None of the newly issued shares are subject to lock-in restrictions
- Total of 925,844 new equity shares across all four companies

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing employee stock option schemes as per SEBI guidelines.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their systems to reflect the newly listed securities
- The new shares will be available for trading alongside existing shares of the respective companies
- Normal trading rules and regulations apply to these securities from the listing date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 14, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date**: Wednesday, October 15, 2025
- **Lock-in Period**: Not Applicable (NA) for all four companies

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The issuance represents routine ESOP/ESOS allotments that are part of standard employee compensation practices. The quantum of shares being listed is relatively small compared to the outstanding share capital of these companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in free float for the respective companies. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares can be traded immediately, though the small quantities are unlikely to affect market dynamics.

**Investor Impact**: No material impact on existing shareholders. ESOP issuances are typically factored into dilution expectations and are disclosed in advance through company filings. The notice provides transparency on the distinctive numbers and ISINs for tracking purposes.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure their systems recognize the expanded share capital and distinctive number ranges for accurate settlement and reconciliation.
