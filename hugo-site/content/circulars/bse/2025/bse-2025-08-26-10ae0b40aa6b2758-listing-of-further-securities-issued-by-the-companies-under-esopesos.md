## Summary

## Key Points

- Total of 423,850 shares issued across 12 different tranches
- All securities subject to lock-in provisions
- Lock-in expiry dates primarily on September 17-18, 2025
- Share issuances range from 1,000 to 200,000 shares per tranche
- Specific share number ranges provided for each issuance

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must adhere to lock-in period requirements
- Shares cannot be traded until respective lock-in expiry dates
- Companies must maintain proper records of share number ranges

## Important Dates

- September 17, 2025: Lock-in expiry for 2 tranches (28,000 shares)
- September 18, 2025: Lock-in expiry for 10 tranches (395,850 shares)
