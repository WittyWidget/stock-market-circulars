## Compliance Requirements

- Investment Companies and Investment Holding Companies must continue to meet eligibility criteria for special call-auction mechanism

- Financial data must be based on standalone financials as prescribed by BSE

## Important Dates

- **Reference Date for Prices:** October 15, 2025
- **Reference Date for Financial Data:** March 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects trading mechanism for 14 specific companies. Investors in these securities must use the special call-auction mechanism rather than regular market trading.

**Transparency:** The disclosure provides critical information showing significant divergence between market prices and book values for several companies, particularly those with high proportions of assets in other listed companies (e.g., Kama Holdings at 4800%, TVS Holdings at 2090%).

**Investment Considerations:** The data reveals that many of these investment companies trade at substantial premiums or discounts to their book values, with asset compositions heavily weighted toward investments in other listed entities. This information is essential for price discovery in the special call-auction mechanism.
