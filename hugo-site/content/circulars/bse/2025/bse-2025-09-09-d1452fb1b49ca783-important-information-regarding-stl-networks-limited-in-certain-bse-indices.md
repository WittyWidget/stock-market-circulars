## Summary

BSE Index Services Private Ltd announced that STL Networks Limited (Scrip code: 544395) will be excluded from multiple BSE indices effective prior to trading on September 11, 2025. The exclusion follows the company's failure to hit the lower circuit on September 8 and 9, 2025, as part of the predetermined process for removal of spun-off scrips from BSE indices following demerger schemes.

## Key Points

- Company will be excluded from 8 BSE indices effective September 11, 2025
- Action follows BSE's established process for handling spun-off scrips post-demerger
- Exclusion included in end-of-day corporate action file (*.SDE)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This action implements existing BSE process announced via Notice No: 20250403-46 for removal of spun-off scrips from BSE Indices following demerger schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the index exclusion for portfolio rebalancing
- Investors tracking affected indices should adjust holdings accordingly

## Important Dates

- **September 11, 2025**: STL Networks Limited exclusion from BSE indices effective prior to market open

## Impact Assessment

The exclusion affects STL Networks Limited's presence in 8 major BSE indices including BSE SMALLCAP, BSE ALLCAP, BSE TELECOMMUNICATION, and others. This may impact index fund holdings and passive investment strategies tracking these indices. The exclusion is procedural following demerger process rather than performance-based, limiting broader market implications.
