## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for employee stock option shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities availability
- Securities are immediately tradable with no restrictions
- Companies have completed their ESOP/ESOS allotment formalities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 16, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: Friday, October 17, 2025
- **Lock-in Period**: Not Applicable (NA) for all securities

## Impact Assessment

The market impact is minimal as these are routine ESOP/ESOS allotments representing employee compensation conversions. The largest allotment is Suzlon Energy with 1.248 million shares, which is typically a small percentage of total outstanding shares. The absence of lock-in periods means shares are immediately available for trading, though employee stock options are generally held for longer periods. This is a standard corporate action with no material effect on market operations or trading dynamics.
