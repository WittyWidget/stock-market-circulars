Medium impact on debt market participants and state government financing. The large combined issue size of Rs. 31,000 crores provides significant investment opportunities for institutional and retail investors. The inclusion of multiple states (Assam, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttarakhand) diversifies credit exposure across different state economies.
