Effective October 27, 2025, Goenka Diamond & Jewels Ltd (Scrip Code: 533189, ISIN: INE516K01024) has been placed under Stage 1 Additional Surveillance Measure. No securities are being moved to Stage 0, excluded from surveillance, or transitioning between Stage 1 and Stage 2.

## Key Points

- No securities being excluded from ASM for IBC
- Circular includes consolidated list of all securities currently under IBC surveillance framework
- Special notations apply: (*) indicates NSE-aligned securities, (~) marks T+0 scrips under parent company IBC framework, (^) denotes recommencement scrips

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements the framework for Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) for companies under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The IBC surveillance framework operates in stages:

- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company regarding insolvency proceedings
- **Stage 1**: Additional Surveillance Measure for Companies relating to Insolvency Resolution Process
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance for companies remaining under IBC proceedings

The consolidated list shows 14+ securities currently under various stages of IBC surveillance, including companies like Aban Offshore Ltd, AGS Transact Technologies Ltd, Alchemist Ltd, Alps Industries Ltd, and others.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the surveillance status of Goenka Diamond & Jewels Ltd when trading
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting requirements apply to securities under Stage 1 surveillance
- Investors should be aware of increased risk associated with securities under IBC proceedings
- Trading members must ensure compliance with applicable surveillance framework restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 27, 2025 - Goenka Diamond & Jewels Ltd moves to Stage 1 surveillance
- **Circular Issue Date**: October 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of one security to Stage 1 surveillance indicates ongoing insolvency proceedings that may affect investor confidence and trading activity in the affected security.

**Operational Impact**: Trading in Goenka Diamond & Jewels Ltd will be subject to additional surveillance measures, potentially including price bands, trading limits, or enhanced disclosure requirements.

**Investor Risk**: Securities under IBC surveillance carry elevated risk due to ongoing insolvency proceedings. The consolidated list provides transparency on all affected securities, enabling informed investment decisions.
