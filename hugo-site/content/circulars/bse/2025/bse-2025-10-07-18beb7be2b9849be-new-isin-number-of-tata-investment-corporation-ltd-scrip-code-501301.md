## Summary

BSE has announced the new ISIN number INE672A01026 for Tata Investment Corporation Ltd (Scrip Code: 501301) following the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs.10/- to Re.1/-. This new ISIN will be effective for all trades executed on and from the ex-date of October 14, 2025. This notice is in continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20250924-73 dated September 24, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN number: INE672A01026
- Company: Tata Investment Corporation Ltd
- Scrip Code: 501301
- Corporate action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Face value change: From Rs.10/- per share to Re.1/- per share
- Sub-division ratio: 10:1 (each share of Rs.10 split into 10 shares of Re.1)
- Related to previous notice: Exchange Notice No. 20250924-73 dated September 24, 2025
- Demat Request (DR) Number: 735/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notification regarding ISIN update following board-approved share sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN INE672A01026 for all trades in Tata Investment Corporation Ltd equity shares (Re.1/- face value) from the ex-date onwards
- Market participants should update their systems and records to reflect the new ISIN for trades executed on or after October 14, 2025
- Depositories and custodians need to ensure proper mapping of the new ISIN in their systems

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 07, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: October 14, 2025 (new ISIN becomes effective for trading)
- **Previous Related Notice**: September 24, 2025 (Exchange Notice No. 20250924-73)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division from Rs.10 to Re.1 (10:1 ratio) will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while reducing the share price proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members, custodians, and market infrastructure providers must update their systems to recognize the new ISIN from the ex-date. Existing shareholders will see their holdings adjusted automatically - each share of Rs.10 face value will be converted into 10 shares of Re.1 face value.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held, with no change in their total investment value. The lower price per share post-split may attract more retail participation.
