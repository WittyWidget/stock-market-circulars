---

## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for 61 securities, effective from October 13, 2025. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, representing changes from their existing levels. Price bands are circuit limits that restrict the maximum price movement of a security during a trading session. This surveillance measure affects stocks across various sectors including infrastructure, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and services.

## Key Points

- 61 securities will have revised price bands effective October 13, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (strictest) to 20% (most relaxed)
- Changes affect equities in the trading segment
- Most common revised bands are 5% (28 securities) and 20% (16 securities)
- Other bands include 2% (1 security), 10% (16 securities)
- Notice issued on October 10, 2025 with 3 days advance notice
- Members can seek clarification at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

This circular implements revised price band limits as a surveillance measure. Price bands restrict the maximum percentage change in a stock's price during a trading session to control excessive volatility. The revision indicates BSE's reassessment of volatility controls for these specific securities based on surveillance parameters.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised price bands for affected securities
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect new circuit limits by October 13, 2025
- Price movements beyond the specified bands will trigger trading halts
- Members requiring clarification should contact BSE surveillance team

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 10, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 13, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The revised price bands will affect trading dynamics for these 61 securities. Tighter bands (2-5%) indicate heightened surveillance concerns and will limit intraday price movements, potentially reducing speculative activity. Wider bands (20%) suggest relatively relaxed controls. Traders and investors in these securities need to adjust strategies according to the new circuit limits.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their systems and inform clients about the new limits. Algorithmic trading strategies may need recalibration for affected securities. The advance notice of 3 days provides minimal preparation time for system updates.
