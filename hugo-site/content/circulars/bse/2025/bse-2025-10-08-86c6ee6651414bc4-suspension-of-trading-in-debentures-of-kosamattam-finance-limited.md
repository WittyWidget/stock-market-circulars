## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of Kosamattam Finance Limited (ISIN: INE403Q07DH0, Code: 938538) effective October 13, 2025. The suspension is due to the company setting a record date for redemption of its debentures. Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to debentures with ISIN INE403Q07DH0 (Code: 938538)
- Suspension is specifically for the KFL-28-10-25-NCD series
- Notice issued under reference number 20251008-35 and DR-734/2025-2026
- All trading members must comply with the no-dealings directive

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard operational suspension triggered by corporate action (redemption).

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealings in the specified debentures from October 13, 2025
- No buy or sell transactions should be executed for ISIN INE403Q07DH0
- Members must update their systems to prevent inadvertent trades

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 8, 2025
- **Record Date**: October 13, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The suspension affects only holders and potential traders of Kosamattam Finance Limited's specific NCD series. Investors holding these debentures cannot trade them from October 13, 2025, as the record date for redemption will be established. This is a routine corporate action with limited market-wide impact, affecting only this particular debt instrument's liquidity until redemption is completed.
