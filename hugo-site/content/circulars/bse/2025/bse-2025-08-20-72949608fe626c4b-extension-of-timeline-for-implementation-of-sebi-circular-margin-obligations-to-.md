title: Extension of timeline for implementation of SEBI Circular on Margin obligations
  via pledge/Re-pledge in Depository System
---

## Summary

SEBI has extended the implementation timeline for its circular on 'Margin obligations to be given by way of pledge/Re-pledge in the Depository System' from September 01, 2025 to October 10, 2025. The extension was granted following requests from depositories (CDSL and NSDL) for additional time to complete system developments and end-to-end testing.

## Key Points

- Original implementation date was September 01, 2025
- New implementation date is October 10, 2025
- Extension requested by depositories CDSL and NSDL
- Reason: Need more time for system developments and testing
- Aims to ensure smooth implementation without market disruption

## Regulatory Changes

No changes to the underlying regulatory requirements - only the implementation timeline has been extended by approximately 5 weeks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Stock Exchanges, Depositories and Clearing Corporations must notify their members/participants
- Entities must disseminate information on their websites
- Appropriate systems and procedures must be established for compliance
- Necessary amendments to Bye-laws, Rules and Regulations must be made

## Important Dates

- **Original Implementation Date**: September 01, 2025
- **Extended Implementation Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Circular Issue Date**: August 18, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The extension provides necessary breathing room for market infrastructure entities to ensure system readiness. This proactive approach aims to prevent potential disruptions that could occur from rushed implementation. The delay affects the timeline for margin obligation processes through the depository system but ensures more robust implementation when the system goes live.
