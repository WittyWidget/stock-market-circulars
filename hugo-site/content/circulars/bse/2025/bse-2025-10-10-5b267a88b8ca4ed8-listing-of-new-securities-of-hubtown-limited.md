## Regulatory Changes

- The allotted shares are subject to mandatory lock-in restrictions

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 15.81 lakh shares increases the total equity capital of Hubtown Limited. However, since these shares are allotted to promoters on preferential basis with an 18-month lock-in period, immediate trading liquidity will not be affected. The lock-in until May 2027 prevents these shares from entering the market immediately.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing minority shareholders experience dilution as promoters have increased their stake through warrant conversion. The premium pricing at Rs. 220/- suggests confidence from promoters in the company's prospects.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - This is a standard listing procedure that does not affect day-to-day trading operations beyond system updates to reflect the increased share capital.
