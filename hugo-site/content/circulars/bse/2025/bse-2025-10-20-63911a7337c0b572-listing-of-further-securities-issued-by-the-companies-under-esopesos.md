## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 20, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date**: October 21, 2025 (Tuesday)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The issuance represents routine ESOP/ESOS allotments that are expected corporate actions. The share quantities are relatively small compared to the free float of most listed companies.

**Dilution Impact**: Minor dilution to existing shareholders across the 10 companies, with percentages varying by company size. ICICI Bank has the highest number of shares (125,223) but given its large capital base, the dilution is negligible.

**Liquidity Impact**: Neutral to slightly positive. Additional shares in circulation may marginally improve liquidity, though the absence of lock-in periods means employees can trade immediately.

**Sector Distribution**: Diversified across banking (AU Small Finance Bank, AXIS Bank, ICICI Bank), finance (IIFL Finance), pharmaceuticals (Jagsonpal, Poly Medicure, Sai Life Sciences), technology (Onward Technologies), exports (Gokaldas Exports), and trading (Renaissance Global).
