## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The issuance of shares under ESOP/ESOS is a routine corporate action reflecting employee compensation and retention strategies. The quantities involved represent a small fraction of the total outstanding shares for these companies.

**Liquidity Impact**: Negligible increase in float for listed companies. Most shares have no lock-in restrictions and can be traded immediately.

**Dilution Impact**: Minor dilution for existing shareholders. For example, ICICI Bank's 519,159 shares represent minimal dilution given its large market capitalization.

**Investor Consideration**: This is routine administrative information. ESOP issuances are typically positive signals indicating employee retention and alignment with shareholder interests.
