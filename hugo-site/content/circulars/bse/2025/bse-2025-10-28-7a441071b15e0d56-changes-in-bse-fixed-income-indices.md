## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects fixed income index funds and sovereign bond portfolios tracking this benchmark.

**Operational Impact:** Index-tracking funds will need to execute trades to swap out the old benchmark security for the new one, potentially involving significant transaction volumes depending on assets under management.

**Investment Impact:** The yield difference between the two securities (6.33% vs 6.48%) and slight maturity date difference may result in minor performance variations for index-tracking products. Passive investors in index funds tracking this benchmark will experience automatic rebalancing without action required.
