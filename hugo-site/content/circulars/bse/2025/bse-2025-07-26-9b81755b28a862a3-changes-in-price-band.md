title: BSE Price Band Revisions for 64 Scrips Effective July 28, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revised price bands for 64 equity scrips effective July 28, 2025. The price bands have been adjusted to various levels ranging from 2% to 20%, representing changes from their existing levels. This is a routine surveillance measure to manage trading volatility in these securities.

## Key Points

- 64 scrips will have revised price bands effective July 28, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% to 20% based on individual scrip assessment
- Changes affect equity segment trading only
- Notice issued by BSE Surveillance department
- Members can seek clarifications at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

BSE has modified the existing price band parameters for the listed scrips. Price bands are regulatory tools used to limit the maximum price movement (both upward and downward) that a stock can experience during a trading session.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with new price band limits from July 28, 2025
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect the revised price bands
- Members should communicate changes to their clients trading in affected scrips

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 28, 2025
- **Notice Date**: July 25, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will directly impact trading in the 64 affected scrips by limiting their daily price movement. Stocks with tighter bands (2-5%) will have more restricted price movements, while those with wider bands (10-20%) will allow for greater volatility. This measure is designed to prevent excessive speculation and maintain orderly trading, particularly important for smaller and mid-cap stocks that may be more susceptible to price manipulation.
