## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment increases Kothari Industrial Corporation's equity base by 1,31,57,600 shares. Lock-in periods ranging from approximately 7 to 19 months ensure these shares cannot be immediately traded by allottees, limiting short-term supply impact. The listing enables normal trading operations for these securities while maintaining regulatory compliance through the lock-in mechanism.
