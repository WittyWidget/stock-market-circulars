## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of shares from warrant conversion for a single company with a relatively small number of shares (3.64 lakh shares).

**Liquidity Impact**: Limited increase in floating stock for Omega Interactive Technologies Ltd., though all shares are subject to lock-in until May 31, 2026, preventing immediate trading.

**Investor Impact**: Relevant only to non-promoter warrant holders who have converted their warrants. The lock-in restriction means these shares cannot be traded for approximately 8 months from the trading commencement date.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and new distinctive number ranges for this security.
