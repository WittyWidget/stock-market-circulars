- 13,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 493849500-493862499): Lock-in until April 29, 2026
- 2,95,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 493862500-494157499): Lock-in until April 30, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The listing involves 3.08 lakh shares representing a small capital raise through warrant conversion. The issue price of Rs. 316 per share indicates confidence from non-promoter investors.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible immediate impact as all shares are under lock-in until April 2026. Post lock-in expiry, the additional float will marginally increase tradable shares.

**Dilution:** The preferential allotment to non-promoters will result in minor equity dilution, with shares issued at a significant premium to face value, adding to the company's capital base.

**Investor Considerations:** Existing shareholders should note the upcoming lock-in expiry dates in April 2026, which could affect supply-demand dynamics at that time.
