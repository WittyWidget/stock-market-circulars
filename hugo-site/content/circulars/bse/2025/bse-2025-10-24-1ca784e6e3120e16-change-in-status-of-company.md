## Summary

BSE has announced that the delisting of Birla Capital & Financial Services Ltd (Scrip Code: 512332) has been rescinded following an order issued by the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal. Consequently, the company's status will be changed from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective October 28, 2025. This status change also means that certain provisions of SEBI's Delisting Regulations will no longer apply to the company.

## Key Points

- Delisting of Birla Capital & Financial Services Ltd (Scrip Code: 512332) has been rescinded
- Change is pursuant to an order from the Securities Appellate Tribunal
- Company status will change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"
- Regulation 24(1) and 24(2) of SEBI Delisting of Equity Shares Regulations, 2009 will not be applicable
- Notice issued by Deputy Vice President Netra Sahani and Manager Manish Raval from Listing Compliance

## Regulatory Changes

The rescission of delisting results in non-applicability of specific SEBI regulations:
- Regulation 24(1) of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 - no longer applicable
- Regulation 24(2) of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 - no longer applicable

These provisions typically govern post-delisting obligations and procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- BSE will change the company's status from "Delisted" to "Suspended" in its records
- The company will be treated under suspended security provisions rather than delisted security provisions
- Market participants should note that "Suspended" status means the security is not available for trading

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 24, 2025
- **Status Change Effective Date:** October 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** This is a significant but rare event where a tribunal order has reversed a delisting decision. While the company's status is changing to "Suspended" rather than being restored to active trading, this represents a procedural reversal that could have implications for the company's future listing status.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders of Birla Capital & Financial Services Ltd may see this as a positive development, though the suspended status means shares still cannot be traded on the exchange. The tribunal order suggests ongoing legal proceedings or appeals regarding the company's listing status.

**Operational Impact:** The company transitions from delisted regulatory framework to suspended security framework, which may have different compliance and reporting requirements. The non-applicability of Regulation 24(1) and 24(2) suggests the company is no longer subject to certain post-delisting obligations.
