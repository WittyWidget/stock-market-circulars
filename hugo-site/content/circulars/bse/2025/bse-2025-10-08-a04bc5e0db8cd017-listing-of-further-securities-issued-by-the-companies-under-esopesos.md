## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new shares for trade settlement purposes
- Companies must ensure proper dematerialization and credit to employee demat accounts
- Standard post-listing compliance applies including shareholding pattern disclosures

- **Notice Date**: October 8, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: October 9, 2025 (Thursday)
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not Applicable (NA) - no lock-in restrictions

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The total dilution is relatively small across all companies. ICICI Bank's 519,475 shares represent negligible dilution given its large equity base. No lock-in restrictions mean shares are immediately tradable, though employee exercise patterns typically result in gradual market absorption.

**Operational Impact**: Routine administrative listing. No impact on trading operations or existing shareholder rights. Companies continue standard ESOP/ESOS programs for employee retention and incentivization.

**Investor Consideration**: Marginal increase in outstanding shares may have minimal effect on earnings per share calculations. Investors should monitor ongoing ESOP dilution trends in quarterly shareholding patterns.
