---

## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and trading permission for 60 bonus equity shares of ICICI Bank Limited (Scrip Code: 532174) that were previously kept in abeyance. These shares will be available for trading from October 28, 2025. The shares have a face value of Rs. 2/- each and are assigned ISIN INE090A01021.

## Key Points

- Total of 60 bonus equity shares being listed
- Face value: Rs. 2/- per share
- Scrip Code: 532174
- ISIN: INE090A01021
- Three separate batches: 10 shares, 25 shares, and 25 shares
- Distinctive numbers assigned for tracking

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing procedure for bonus shares that were previously held in abeyance.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members of the exchange are informed to note the listing of these securities. No specific compliance actions required from members beyond normal trading procedures.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 27, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: October 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact is negligible as only 60 shares are involved. These shares were previously kept in abeyance (typically due to pending regulatory approvals or dispute resolution) and are now being released for trading. Given ICICI Bank's large outstanding share base, the addition of 60 shares will have no material impact on liquidity or price. This is purely an administrative listing action.
