## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is an operational modification to previously announced NFO schedule referenced in Notice No. 20250930-70 dated September 30, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

**For BSE Members:**
- Ensure clients initiate funds by 9:00 AM on T+1 day to avoid cancellation
- Clear funds must be available in ICCL Account by 6:00 PM on October 20, 2025
- For cheque and OTM payments, ensure funds reach ICCL account by deadline

- Report cancelled transactions (CC with N flag) to RTA/AMC as applicable

## Important Dates

- **October 15, 2025 (Midnight)**: NFO extended closing date
- **T+1 Day (9:00 AM)**: Deadline for clients to initiate funds (transactions without funds will be cancelled)
- **October 20, 2025 (6:00 PM)**: Clear funds must be available in ICCL Account
- **October 20, 2025**: Tentative allotment date (revised from October 23, 2025)
- **3:00 PM on last payout day or T+5**: Pending transactions with initiated payment remain in system till this time

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - The three-day advancement of the allotment date compresses the settlement timeline, requiring members and investors to expedite fund arrangements. Members need to adjust their operational workflows to accommodate the accelerated schedule.

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - Affects only participants in this specific NFO on BSE StAR MF platform. Does not impact broader market operations.

**Investor Impact:** Medium - Investors and members must ensure faster fund availability (by October 20 instead of October 23). Risk of transaction cancellation if funds not initiated by T+1 9:00 AM. Switch transactions require careful timing to ensure funds availability before allotment.

**Risk Considerations:** Members using cheques or OTM payment methods face higher operational risk due to compressed timeline. Switch transactions from schemes with longer payout TAT may miss allotment if funds arrive after October 20, 2025.
