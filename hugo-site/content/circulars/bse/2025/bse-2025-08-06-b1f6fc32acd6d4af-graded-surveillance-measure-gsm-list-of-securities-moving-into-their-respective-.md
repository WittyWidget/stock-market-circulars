title: GSM Framework Updates - Four Securities Moving to Higher Surveillance Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of four securities to higher stages under the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. One security moves to GSM Stage I while three securities move to GSM Stage II, indicating increased regulatory oversight due to various risk factors.

## Key Points

- Prashant India Ltd (519014) moves to GSM Stage I
- P.M. Telelinnks Ltd (513403), GSL Securities Ltd (530469), and Hindustan Fluorocarbons Ltd (524013) move to GSM Stage II
- GSM framework provides graded surveillance based on risk assessment
- Securities in higher GSM stages face additional trading restrictions and compliance requirements

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework allows for dynamic movement of securities between surveillance stages based on risk parameters. Securities can move to lower GSM stages if they are included in ESM (Enhanced Surveillance Measure) or IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Enhanced disclosure requirements for companies in higher GSM stages
- Additional margin requirements for trading these securities
- Periodic reviews and compliance monitoring
- Investors must be aware of increased risk profile of these securities

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: August 6, 2025
- GSM stage changes are typically reviewed periodically based on company performance and compliance

## Impact Assessment

The movement to higher GSM stages will result in:
- Reduced liquidity due to additional trading restrictions
- Higher margin requirements for investors
- Increased scrutiny of corporate actions and disclosures
- Potential impact on stock prices due to reduced investor participation
- Enhanced protection for retail investors through additional safeguards
