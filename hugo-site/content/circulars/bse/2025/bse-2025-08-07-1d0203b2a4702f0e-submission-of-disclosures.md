title: BSE Advisory on Simultaneous Disclosure Submission Across Multiple Exchanges
---

## Summary

The circular addresses the issue of time lag in disclosure submissions by entities listed on multiple exchanges, particularly for financial results and price sensitive information, which creates information asymmetry in the market.

## Key Points

- Entities listed on multiple exchanges must submit disclosures simultaneously to all exchanges
- BSE has observed time lags in certain disclosures, particularly financial results and price sensitive information
- Time lag in disclosures leads to information asymmetry in the market
- This is a governance measure in the larger interest of investors

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory requirements introduced. This is an advisory reinforcing existing obligations for simultaneous disclosure submission across multiple exchanges.

## Compliance Requirements

- All multi-exchange listed entities must ensure simultaneous submission of disclosures to all exchanges where they are listed
- Particular attention required for financial results and price sensitive information disclosures
- Entities must avoid any time lag between submissions to different exchanges

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: August 7, 2025
