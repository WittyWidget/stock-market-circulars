## Summary

BSE has updated the surveillance framework for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Three securities have been shortlisted and added to Stage 1 of Additional Surveillance Measure for Companies relating to the Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP). No securities are being moved to Stage 0, moved between stages, or excluded from the framework. The changes are effective from October 24, 2025.

## Key Points

- Three securities added to IBC Stage 1: Steelco Gujarat Ltd (500399), String Metaverse Ltd (534535), and Vas Infrastructure Ltd (531574)
- No securities added to Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure)
- No securities moving from Stage I to Stage II
- No securities moving from Stage II to Stage I
- No securities being excluded from the IBC surveillance framework
- Consolidated list shows 13+ securities under various stages of IBC surveillance
- Framework includes special markings for T+0 scrips and recommencement scrips

## Regulatory Changes

The surveillance framework under IBC continues to operate with the following stages:

- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company regarding insolvency
- **Stage 1**: Additional Surveillance Measure for Companies relating to Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP)
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance for companies under IBC

Securities can move between stages based on the progression or resolution of insolvency proceedings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under IBC surveillance framework
