title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework Updates - Securities List Changes
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework with changes effective August 26, 2025. Three new securities are being added to ESM, three existing securities will move to higher ESM stages, and no securities are moving out of the framework.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities added to ESM Framework: Bangalore Fort Farms Ltd, Fredun Pharmaceuticals Ltd, and Fundviser Capital (India) Ltd
- 3 securities moving to higher ESM stages: Bemco Hydraulics Ltd, Kesar Terminals & Infrastructure Ltd, and Praxis Home Retail Ltd
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages or exiting the framework
- Comprehensive consolidated list provided showing all securities currently under ESM with their respective stages
- Framework includes both main board and SME securities

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM Framework continues to be implemented as per existing regulations with periodic updates to the securities list based on surveillance parameters and trading patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ESM requirements for listed securities
- Enhanced due diligence and monitoring required for securities under ESM
- Clients must be informed about ESM status of securities before trading

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 26, 2025 - All ESM changes become effective

## Impact Assessment

The changes will result in enhanced surveillance and potentially restricted trading conditions for the affected securities. Securities in higher ESM stages face stricter trading parameters including higher margin requirements and reduced position limits. This measure aims to protect investor interests by monitoring securities with unusual price movements or trading patterns.
