## Impact Assessment

This circular has medium impact limited to existing shareholders of Ashnisha Industries Limited who wish to participate in the rights issue or trade their rights entitlements. Trading members handling this security need to ensure proper disclosure and client communication. The trade-for-trade settlement mechanism and dematerialized-only requirement ensures transparency and reduces settlement risk. Shareholders must act within the specified timeframe to either subscribe, renounce, or trade their REs to avoid lapsing of entitlements after November 03, 2025.
