## Impact Assessment

This is a company-specific corporate action with minimal market-wide impact. The listing represents a relatively small issuance (5.275 lakh shares) from warrant conversion on a preferential basis. The 18-month lock-in period (from allotment to April 2026) restricts immediate trading liquidity for these shares. Impact is limited to existing shareholders and investors of Hazoor Multi Projects Limited. No changes to trading rules or market operations for other securities.
