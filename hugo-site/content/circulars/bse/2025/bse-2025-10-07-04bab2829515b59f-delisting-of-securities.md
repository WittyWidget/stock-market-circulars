## Summary

BSE has announced the delisting of four debt scrip codes effective October 8, 2025.

## Key Points

- Four debt scrip codes will be delisted from BSE effective October 8, 2025
- All securities were already suspended prior to delisting
- Delisting follows maturity and/or redemption record dates
- Affects three companies: Alder Residency, Edel Finance, and Muthoot Microfin

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a routine administrative action for debt securities that have reached maturity or redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members are required to take note of the delisting. No specific compliance actions needed as securities were already suspended from trading.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 7, 2025
- **Delisting Effective Date**: October 8, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. These debt securities were already suspended from trading due to maturity/redemption, so the delisting is purely an administrative measure to formally remove them from the exchange. No trading disruption expected as these securities were not actively traded.
