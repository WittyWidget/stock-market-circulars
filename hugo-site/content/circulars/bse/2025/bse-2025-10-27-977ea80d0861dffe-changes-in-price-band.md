## Regulatory Changes

This circular represents a surveillance action by BSE to adjust price bands from their existing levels. Price bands are regulatory mechanisms that limit the maximum price movement (up or down) that a security can experience in a single trading session. The revision indicates enhanced or reduced surveillance measures based on individual scrip characteristics.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new price bands
- Orders placed beyond the revised price bands will be rejected
- Members should inform clients about the revised trading limits
- Any clarifications required should be addressed to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 27, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The revised price bands will affect trading dynamics for 15 securities. Tighter price bands (2%, 5%) indicate enhanced surveillance and restricted price movements, potentially signaling volatility concerns or irregular trading patterns. Wider bands (20%) may indicate reduced restrictions for NSB BPO Solutions.

**Trading Impact**: Traders and investors in these securities will face adjusted daily price movement limits, affecting intraday trading strategies, stop-loss placement, and position sizing. Securities with tighter bands may experience reduced liquidity and increased difficulty in price discovery.

**Surveillance Context**: Price band adjustments are typically implemented as part of BSE's surveillance framework to protect investor interests and maintain market integrity, often in response to unusual price movements, volatility, or corporate actions.
