title: Revision of Record Date for Stock Split of TITAN INTECH LTD
---

## Summary

BSE has revised the record date for TITAN INTECH LTD's stock split from September 6, 2025 to September 9, 2025. The stock split will subdivide existing equity shares from Rs.10 each into ten equity shares of Re.1 each. The ex-date remains unchanged at September 8, 2025.

## Key Points

- Record date revised from previous date to September 9, 2025
- Ex-date continues to remain September 8, 2025
- Stock split ratio: 1 share of Rs.10 becomes 10 shares of Re.1 each
- New ISIN number will be effective from ex-date (September 8, 2025)
- Applies to dematerialised securities under rolling settlement segment

## Regulatory Changes

New ISIN number for equity shares of Re.1 each will be effective for trades from the ex-date (September 8, 2025) under reference DR-710/2025-2026.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the revised record date and ensure proper handling of the stock split in their systems and client communications.

## Important Dates

- **Ex-date**: September 8, 2025
- **Record date**: September 9, 2025 (revised)
- **New ISIN effective**: September 8, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The stock split will increase the number of shares outstanding by 10 times while reducing the face value proportionally. This typically makes shares more accessible to retail investors due to lower absolute price per share. Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date.
