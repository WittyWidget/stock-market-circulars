BSE has announced that KSE Ltd (Scrip Code: 519421) will be assigned a new ISIN number INE953E01022 for its sub-divided equity shares. This change follows the sub-division of equity shares from face value of Rs.10/- to Re.1/- and will be effective for trades executed on and from the ex-date of October 28, 2025.

## Key Points

- New ISIN number: INE953E01022
- Company: KSE Ltd (Scrip Code: 519421)
- Corporate action: Sub-division of equity shares
- Old face value: Rs.10/- per share
- New face value: Re.1/- per share (10:1 split ratio)
- Ex-date for new ISIN: October 28, 2025
- Demat Request (DR) reference: 744/2025-2026
- Continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251009-10 dated October 09, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for ISIN change following share sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems to recognize the new ISIN number INE953E01022 for KSE Ltd equity shares of Re.1/- face value
- The new ISIN must be used for all trades executed on or after October 28, 2025
- Members should ensure proper mapping of old and new ISIN in their trading and settlement systems

## Important Dates

- **October 09, 2025**: Original notice date (Exchange Notice No. 20251009-10)
- **October 24, 2025**: Current notice date confirming new ISIN details
- **October 28, 2025**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for trading

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division increases liquidity by reducing per-share price, potentially making the stock more accessible to retail investors. The 10:1 split ratio significantly increases the number of outstanding shares.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and market infrastructure providers must update systems to handle the new ISIN. Investors holding shares in demat form will see automatic adjustment with 10 new shares for every 1 old share held. No action required from investors but they should verify post-split holdings after the ex-date.
