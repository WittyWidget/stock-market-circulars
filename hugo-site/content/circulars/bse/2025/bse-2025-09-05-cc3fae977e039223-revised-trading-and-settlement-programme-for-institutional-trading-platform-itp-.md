The circular outlines 21 settlement cycles (ITP-105/25-26 through ITP-125/25-26) with standard and modified pay-in/pay-out timings for specific dates.

## Key Points

- 21 settlement cycles scheduled from September 1-30, 2025 (ITP-105/25-26 to ITP-125/25-26)
- Standard pay-in timing: 10:00 a.m. with instructions to be submitted by 9:50 a.m.
- Standard pay-out timing: 11:00 a.m. for funds and securities
- Four settlement dates (September 9-10, 2025) have modified timings with two pay-in/pay-out cycles per day
- Settlement numbers follow depository settlement number sequence 2526105 to 2526125
- Applicable to ITP-SME segment only

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine operational schedule update for the ITP-SME segment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must submit pay-in instructions to Depositories/banks by 9:50 a.m. for standard settlements
- For modified settlement timings on September 9-10, 2025:
  - Morning cycle: Submit instructions by 9:50 a.m. (pay-in at 10:00 a.m., pay-out at 12:30 p.m.)
  - Evening cycle: Submit instructions by 4:20 p.m. (pay-in at 4:30 p.m., pay-out at 9:30 p.m.)
- Members must adhere to the published settlement schedule for all ITP-SME transactions

## Important Dates

**Modified Settlement Timings:**

- **ITP-108/25-26** (Trade: Sep 4, Settlement: Sep 9): Pay-in 10:00 a.m., Pay-out 12:30 p.m.
- **ITP-109/25-26** (Trade: Sep 5, Settlement: Sep 9): Pay-in 4:30 p.m., Pay-out 9:30 p.m.

**Effective Period:** September 1, 2025 to September 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Medium - The revised schedule affects institutional traders participating in the SME segment through ITP. The presence of dual settlement cycles on September 9-10 requires operational adjustments for members to manage two separate pay-in/pay-out windows on these dates.

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine operational schedule that does not affect trading rules, eligibility criteria, or market structure. The impact is limited to settlement operations for ITP-SME participants.

**Member Impact:** Medium - Members trading on ITP-SME segment must adjust their settlement processes for the modified timings, particularly ensuring compliance with the evening cycle submission deadline of 4:20 p.m. for settlements scheduled on September 9-10, 2025.
