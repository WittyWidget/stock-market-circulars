- Tamilnadu Steel Tubes Ltd (Scrip Code: 513540, ISIN: INE176E01012)

## Regulatory Changes

Enhanced surveillance measures impose additional restrictions on trading including:
- Price bands and position limits
- 100% margin requirements
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Periodic review mechanisms

## Compliance Requirements
