**Operational Impact:** Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and be aware of lock-in restrictions on specific distinction numbers.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders will experience minor dilution. The preferential allotment to promoters and non-promoters at Rs. 470.70 per share indicates confidence in the company's valuation at that level.
