## Suspended Securities Details

| Sr. No. | Scrip Code | ISIN | Particulars |
|---------|------------|------|-------------|
| 1 | 804982 | IN002024Z297 | 364TB301025 |

| 3 | 800273 | IN0020170075 | Sovereign Gold Bond 2017 Series I |

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute trades in the above-mentioned securities from October 28, 2025 onwards
- Members should update their systems and inform clients holding these securities about the trading suspension
- Redemption proceedings will follow standard maturity procedures on October 30, 2025

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 27, 2025
- **Trading Suspension Effective Date**: October 28, 2025
- **Maturity/Redemption Date**: October 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational circular with limited market impact. The suspension affects holders of specific T-bills and the 2017 Sovereign Gold Bond series who will not be able to trade these securities in the final two days before maturity. Investors holding these securities will receive redemption proceeds as per standard procedures. The short notice period (one day) between announcement and suspension is standard practice for maturing debt instruments. No broader market disruption is expected as this affects only three specific securities approaching natural maturity.
