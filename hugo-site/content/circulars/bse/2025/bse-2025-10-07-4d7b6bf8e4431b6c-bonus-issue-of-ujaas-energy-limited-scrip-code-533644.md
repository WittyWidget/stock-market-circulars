## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The 2:1 bonus issue will result in significant share count expansion, tripling the number of shares held by public shareholders. This will proportionally reduce the share price while maintaining overall market capitalization.

**Shareholder Impact:** Positive for existing public shareholders who will receive additional shares at no cost, improving liquidity and making shares more affordable for retail investors.

**Trading Impact:** Shares will trade ex-bonus from October 10, 2025, meaning new buyers will not be entitled to the bonus shares. Expected price adjustment on ex-date to reflect the dilution.
