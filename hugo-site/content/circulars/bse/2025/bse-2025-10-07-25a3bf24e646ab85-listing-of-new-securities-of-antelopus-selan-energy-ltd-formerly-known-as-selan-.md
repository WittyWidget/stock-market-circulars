## Impact Assessment

The listing adds approximately 20 million shares to the existing equity base of Antelopus Selan Energy Ltd, representing a significant dilution or expansion depending on the pre-scheme capital structure. This follows a corporate restructuring through merger/demerger involving Antelopus Energy Private Limited. The two-month gap between allotment (August 12) and trading commencement (October 8) suggests regulatory approval processes were completed. Investors should monitor for potential price volatility and increased trading volumes as the new shares enter the market. The scheme of arrangement typically involves transfer of assets, liabilities, or undertakings between entities, which may materially alter the company's business profile.
