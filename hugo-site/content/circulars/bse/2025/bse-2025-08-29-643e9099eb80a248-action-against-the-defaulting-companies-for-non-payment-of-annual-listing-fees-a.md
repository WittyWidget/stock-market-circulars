- Nihar Info Global Limited (531083) will resume trading in "X" group
- Action taken under SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015, Regulation 14
- Continuation of Exchange's compliance enforcement from previous notices dated June 25, 2021 and June 20, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, specifically Regulation 14 regarding Annual Listing Fees payment requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised trading status of the mentioned companies
- Companies must maintain compliance with Annual Listing Fee payment requirements
- Ongoing monitoring of ALF compliance for all listed entities

## Important Dates

- **September 3, 2025**: Trading suspension revocation effective date for both companies

## Impact Assessment

The revocation allows shareholders of these companies to resume trading activities.

This demonstrates BSE's balanced approach to compliance enforcement while providing pathways for companies to restore normal trading status.
