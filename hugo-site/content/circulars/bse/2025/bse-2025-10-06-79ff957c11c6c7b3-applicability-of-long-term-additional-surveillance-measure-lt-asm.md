Eight securities have been newly shortlisted for LT-ASM, one security (Axiscades Technologies Ltd) has been directly placed in Stage IV LT-ASM, and one security (Shri Keshav Cements And Infra Ltd) is moving out of the framework.

## Key Points

- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages within LT-ASM framework
- Framework applies additional surveillance measures to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or trading patterns

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework is designed to alert investors about securities with unusual price movements and concentration of trading by a limited number of participants. Securities under LT-ASM are subject to:

- Reduced price bands
- Higher margin requirements
- Trade-to-trade settlement
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Enhanced monitoring of trading activity

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of securities under LT-ASM framework
- Brokers should inform clients about additional restrictions on affected securities
- Increased margin requirements must be collected for trades in LT-ASM securities
- Only delivery-based trading permitted (no intraday positions)
- Additional surveillance and reporting obligations for exchanges

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 07, 2025 - Changes to LT-ASM framework take effect

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Securities placed under LT-ASM typically experience reduced liquidity due to higher margins and trade-to-trade settlement requirements. This framework serves as an investor protection mechanism but can significantly impact trading volumes and price discovery.

**Investor Impact**: Traders and investors in affected securities will face increased capital requirements and inability to take intraday positions. The framework acts as a warning signal about potential price manipulation or excessive speculation.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update their systems to enforce LT-ASM restrictions including margin collection, position limits, and settlement requirements for the specified securities.
