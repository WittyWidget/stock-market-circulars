The diverse mix of growth-oriented funds, banking/financial sector funds, and international equity funds suggests broad-based appeal.

The strong anchor participation reflects positive outlook on the insurance industry's growth prospects.

**Lock-in**: Anchor investors typically have a 30-day lock-in period from the date of allotment, which provides stability during the initial trading period post-listing.
