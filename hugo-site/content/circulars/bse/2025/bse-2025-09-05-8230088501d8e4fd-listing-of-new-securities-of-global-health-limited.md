## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular confirms compliance with existing SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefit and Sweat Equity) Regulation, 2021, specifically Regulation 22 regarding lock-in requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Global Health Limited must ensure lock-in requirements are enforced at the time of share transfer from trust to employee demat accounts
- Lock-in period as per Regulation 22 and Para 15 of Part B of GHL Plan 2024 must be maintained
- Phased lock-in implementation (1 to 5 years) must be applied based on employee category
- Shares cannot be traded during the applicable lock-in period

## Important Dates

- **September 01, 2025**: Date of undertaking submission to BSE
- **Lock-in commencement**: From the date shares are transferred from GHL Employees Welfare Trust to respective employee demat accounts (specific dates will vary by employee)
- **Lock-in duration**: 1 year (minimum) to 5 years (maximum) from transfer date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing approval for employee stock options involving only 20,000 shares, which represents a negligible portion of Global Health Limited's equity base.

**Operational Impact**: Standard ESOP implementation with regulatory-compliant lock-in periods. The phased lock-in structure (1-5 years) provides flexibility while ensuring employee retention objectives.

**Investor Impact**: No direct impact on existing shareholders. The shares are subject to lock-in and cannot be immediately traded, preventing any dilution pressure on the stock price in the near term.
