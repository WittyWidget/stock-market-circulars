- Adline Chem Lab Ltd (Security Code: 524604, ISIN: INE276T01018) moved to GSM Stage III
- Higher GSM stages impose stricter trading conditions and enhanced monitoring
- Framework includes provisions for securities moving to lower stages due to ESM or IBC inclusion

## Regulatory Changes

## Important Dates
