---

## Summary

BSE has announced corporate actions for two securities in the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) segment. LTIMindtree Limited and Hexaware Technologies Limited have declared dividends with specified ex-dates, record dates, and shut periods during which SLB transactions will be restricted.

## Key Points

- Two companies have dividend corporate actions affecting SLB securities
- LTIMindtree Limited: Ex-date and record date on October 24, 2025
- Hexaware Technologies Limited: Ex-date and record date on October 10, 2025
- Shut periods have been specified for both securities during which SLB operations will be suspended
- No foreclosure dates specified for either security

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine corporate action notification for SLB segment participants.

## Compliance Requirements

- SLB participants must note the shut periods and cannot enter into new lending/borrowing transactions during these periods
- Market participants should adjust their positions before the shut period begins
- Existing SLB positions must be managed considering the dividend ex-date and record date

## Important Dates

**Hexaware Technologies Limited:**
- Ex-Date: October 10, 2025
- Record Date: October 10, 2025
- Shut Period: October 9, 2025 to October 10, 2025

**LTIMindtree Limited:**
- Ex-Date: October 24, 2025
- Record Date: October 24, 2025
- Shut Period: October 23, 2025 to October 24, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The shut periods will temporarily restrict SLB activity for these two major IT sector securities, potentially affecting liquidity and borrowing costs for short sellers and institutional investors.

**Operational Impact:** SLB participants need to plan their lending and borrowing strategies around these shut periods. Securities cannot be lent or borrowed during the specified shut periods, which may impact hedging and arbitrage strategies. The dividend payment will also affect the economics of existing SLB positions, as borrowers typically compensate lenders for dividend payments.
