title: Suspension of Trading in Debentures of MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA FINANCIAL SERVICES
  LIMITED
---

## Summary

BSE has announced suspension of trading in specific non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of MAHINDRA & MAHINDRA FINANCIAL SERVICES LIMITED effective October 10, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date of October 12, 2025 for redemption and interest payment on the MMFSL 8.90%-27-10-25 series (ISIN: INE774D08LO9, Code: 952914).

## Key Points

- Trading Members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures
- ISIN: INE774D08LO9
- Scrip Code: 952914
- Debenture Series: MMFSL-8.90%-27-10-25-PVT
- Notice Reference: DR-733/2025-2026
- Purpose: Redemption of debentures and payment of interest
- This is a private placement NCD series

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard trading suspension procedure implemented before corporate actions involving debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must cease all dealing in the specified debentures from October 10, 2025
- No buy or sell transactions permitted in this debenture series effective from the no-dealings date
- Trading Members must ensure their systems and processes prevent trades in the suspended debentures
- Record date compliance requires suspension to ensure proper identification of debenture holders entitled to redemption and interest

## Important Dates

- **October 6, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 10, 2025**: No dealings commence (trading suspension effective date)
- **October 12, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment
- **October 27, 2025**: Expected maturity/redemption date (based on debenture nomenclature)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to holders and potential traders of this specific NCD series. The suspension is procedural and expected before redemption.

**Investor Impact**: High for current debenture holders who cannot exit positions after October 10, 2025. However, this is expected as the debentures are approaching maturity and redemption.

**Liquidity Impact**: Complete liquidity freeze for this instrument from October 10, 2025, but this is temporary and ends with redemption.

**Operational Impact**: Trading Members must update their systems to block trades in this security. Straightforward compliance requirement with clear timelines.
