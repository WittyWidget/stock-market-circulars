## Summary

BSE has issued a circular announcing the listing of further securities issued by various companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Ownership Schemes (ESOS). This is a routine listing notification for employee stock allocations.

## Key Points

- Companies have issued additional securities under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- These securities will be listed on the BSE platform
- Standard listing procedures will apply to these securities
- This represents employee compensation through equity participation

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes announced. This circular follows existing SEBI guidelines for ESOP/ESOS listings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must ensure proper disclosure of ESOP/ESOS details
- Securities must be listed as per standard BSE listing requirements
- Compliance with SEBI (Share Based Employee Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations

## Important Dates

Effective date: September 2, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as ESOP/ESOS listings are routine corporate actions that typically involve small percentages of total equity. These listings primarily affect employee shareholders and have limited immediate impact on general market participants.
