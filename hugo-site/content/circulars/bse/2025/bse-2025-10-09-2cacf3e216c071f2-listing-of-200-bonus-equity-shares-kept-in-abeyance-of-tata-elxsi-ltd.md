## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 9, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date:** October 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this listing is minimal given the small number of shares (200) being released from abeyance. This is a routine administrative action related to bonus shares that were previously held back, likely due to pending shareholder documentation or other administrative matters that have now been resolved. The market impact is negligible as this represents an extremely small fraction of Tata Elxsi's total equity capital.
