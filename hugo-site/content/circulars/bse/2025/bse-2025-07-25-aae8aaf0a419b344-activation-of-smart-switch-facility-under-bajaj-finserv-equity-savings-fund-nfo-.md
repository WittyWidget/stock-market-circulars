## Summary

BSE has activated the SMART Switch facility for the Bajaj Finserv Equity Savings Fund NFO on the BSE StAR MF platform. This facility allows investors to switch from four existing Bajaj Finserv schemes to the new equity savings fund offering.

## Key Points

- SMART Switch facility activated for Bajaj Finserv Equity Savings Fund NFO
- Available on BSE StAR MF platform
- Four eligible source schemes for switching: Bajaj Finserv Overnight Fund and Liquid Fund (both Regular and Direct plans with Growth options)
- Facility enhancement for mutual fund operations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced - this is an operational facility activation.

## Compliance Requirements

- Fund houses and distributors should update their systems to reflect the new switching options
- Investors can now utilize the SMART Switch facility for the specified schemes

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: July 25, 2025 (as per circular publication)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational enhancement with minimal market impact. The activation primarily benefits existing Bajaj Finserv fund investors by providing additional switching flexibility into the new equity savings fund NFO. The impact is limited to the specific fund house's investor base and does not affect broader market operations or regulatory framework.
