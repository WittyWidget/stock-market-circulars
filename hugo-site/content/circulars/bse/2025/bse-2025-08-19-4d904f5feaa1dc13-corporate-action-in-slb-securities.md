## Summary

BSE has announced corporate action schedules for 16 companies declaring dividends, with ex-dates ranging from August 21, 2025 to September 22, 2025. The circular provides detailed information on book closure dates, ex-dates, and shut periods for Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) transactions.

## Key Points

- 16 companies have announced dividend corporate actions
- Ex-dates span from August 21, 2025 to September 22, 2025
- All actions are dividend distributions with specified shut periods for SLB securities
- Book closure dates align with ex-dates for most companies
- Vedanta Limited and Surya Roshni Ltd have ex-dates one day before book closure dates

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard corporate action notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must observe the specified shut periods for SLB transactions
- Trading systems must reflect ex-dividend status on the specified ex-dates
- Compliance with book closure periods for dividend eligibility determination

## Important Dates

- **Earliest Ex-Date**: August 21, 2025 (Styrenix Performance Materials)
- **Latest Ex-Date**: September 22, 2025 (PNC Infratech, National Fertilizers)
- **Shut Periods**: Range from 1-4 days depending on the company
- **Book Closure Periods**: Vary by company, generally 1-4 days

## Impact Assessment

Moderate impact on trading activities for the affected securities during their respective shut periods. SLB participants need to plan transactions around the specified restriction dates. Dividend distributions may influence stock prices around ex-dates, requiring attention from traders and investors in these 16 companies.
