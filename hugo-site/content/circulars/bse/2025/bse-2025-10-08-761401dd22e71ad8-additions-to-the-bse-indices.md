## Summary

BSE Index Services announces the addition of seven newly listed companies to their respective indices. Two companies will be added to the BSE IPO index effective October 10, 2025, and five companies will be added to the BSE SME IPO index effective October 9, 2025. These additions follow the listing of these companies on BSE on October 8, 2025.

- 2 companies to be added to BSE IPO index: ADVANCE AGROLIFE LIMITED (544562) and OM FREIGHT FORWARDERS LIMITED (544564)
- 5 companies to be added to BSE SME IPO index: CHIRAHARIT LIMITED (544561), ZELIO E MOBILITY LIMITED (544563), VALPLAST TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED (544565), INFINITY INFOWAY LIMITED (544567), and SUNSKY LOGISTICS LIMITED (544566)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notice for index composition updates.

## Compliance Requirements

No specific compliance requirements for market participants. Index tracking funds and portfolios may need to adjust their holdings to reflect the updated index composition.

## Important Dates

- **October 8, 2025**: Listing date for all 7 companies on BSE
- **October 9, 2025**: Effective date for addition of 5 SME companies to BSE SME IPO index (at market open)
- **October 10, 2025**: Effective date for addition of 2 companies to BSE IPO index (at market open)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine index maintenance activity following new listings. The additions affect specialized indices (BSE IPO and BSE SME IPO) rather than major benchmark indices.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. Index tracking funds and products based on these specific indices will need to incorporate these stocks. The staggered effective dates (October 9 and 10) allow for orderly implementation.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to investors and funds tracking the BSE IPO and BSE SME IPO indices. No impact on broader market participants.
