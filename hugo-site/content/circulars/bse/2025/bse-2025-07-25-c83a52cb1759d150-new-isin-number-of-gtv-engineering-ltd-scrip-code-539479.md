This change continues from the earlier exchange notice dated July 22, 2025, and will be effective for trades from the ex-date of July 28, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: GTV Engineering Ltd (Scrip Code: 539479)

- Share sub-division: From Rs.10 per share to Rs.2 per share
- Ex-date for new ISIN: July 28, 2025
- DR Number: 682/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

The company has completed a share sub-division process, requiring a new ISIN number for the subdivided equity shares. This is part of standard corporate action procedures when share denominations change.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members of BSE must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN number for GTV Engineering Ltd shares effective from the ex-date. All trades from July 28, 2025 onwards must use the new ISIN INE910R01024.

## Important Dates

- **July 28, 2025**: Ex-date - New ISIN becomes effective for trading
- **July 25, 2025**: Notice date
- **July 22, 2025**: Initial exchange notice date

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action that affects trading systems and shareholder records. Trading members need to update their systems before the ex-date. Shareholders will receive more shares at a proportionally lower price per share, but the total value remains unchanged. The change may improve liquidity by making shares more affordable for retail investors.
