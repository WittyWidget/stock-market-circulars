## Summary

BSE has announced the exclusion of Dhani Services Ltd (DHANI, Scrip Code: 532960) from the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) segment effective October 28, 2025. This action is taken in view of the ongoing amalgamation of Dhani Services Limited as referenced in previous BSE notices 20251024-55 and 20251027-1. No SLB contracts will be available for trading in this security from the effective date.

## Key Points

- Dhani Services Ltd (SLB Code: DHANI, Equity Scrip Code: 532960) to be excluded from SLB segment
- Effective date: October 28, 2025 (Ex-Date)
- No SLB contracts will be available for trading in this security
- Action taken due to amalgamation of Dhani Services Limited
- References prior notices 20251024-55 and 20251027-1 regarding the amalgamation

## Regulatory Changes

The SLB segment will no longer include Dhani Services Ltd for securities lending and borrowing transactions. This is a permanent exclusion from the SLB trading platform due to the corporate restructuring through amalgamation.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the exclusion of DHANI from SLB segment
- Members should ensure no new SLB contracts are initiated for this security
- Existing positions and obligations related to DHANI SLB contracts should be settled or managed according to exchange regulations prior to the ex-date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 27, 2025
- **Effective Ex-Date**: October 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to participants in the SLB segment who have been trading or lending/borrowing Dhani Services Ltd securities. The exclusion will prevent any new SLB contracts from being created for this security. Market participants holding existing SLB positions in DHANI should prepare for settlement or closure of positions. The broader equity market trading in DHANI remains unaffected, with this change applying only to the SLB segment. This is a procedural step necessitated by the ongoing amalgamation process of the company.
