## Compliance Requirements

**For Members:**
- Ensure clients initiate fund payments by 9:00 AM on T+1 day to avoid transaction cancellation

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects participants in SBI Mutual Fund's Specialized Investment Fund NFO on BSE StAR MF platform.

**Operational Impact:** The three-day advancement of the allotment date creates tighter settlement timelines for members and investors. Payment processing, fund clearance, and switch transaction settlements must be accelerated to meet the new October 20, 2025 deadline. Members need to communicate urgently with clients to ensure timely fund initiation and payment completion.

**Investor Impact:** Investors participating in the NFO must ensure faster payment processing. Those using cheques or OTM payment methods face stricter clearance timelines. Switch transaction participants must verify their switch-out funds will be available before the advanced allotment date to secure unit allotment.
