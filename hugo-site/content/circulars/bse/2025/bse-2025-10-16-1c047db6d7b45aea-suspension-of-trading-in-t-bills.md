## Summary

BSE has issued a notice suspending trading in four T-bills effective October 17, 2025, as they are set to mature on their respective redemption dates. The suspension includes one Sovereign Gold Bond and three Treasury Bills with varying tenures (364-day, 182-day, and 91-day).

## Key Points

- Suspension is due to upcoming maturity/redemption dates
- Instruments include: Sovereign Gold Bond 2017 Series (ISIN: IN0020170067, Scrip: 800270), 364TB231025 (ISIN: IN002024Z289, Scrip: 804979), 182T231025 (ISIN: IN002025Y040, Scrip: 805056), and 91TB231025 (ISIN: IN002025X174, Scrip: 805094)
- Notice reference: DR-738/2025-2026
- Trading members advised not to deal in these securities from the suspension date

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard operational notice for maturing debt instruments.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all trading activities in the specified T-bills from October 17, 2025
- Members should update their systems to reflect the trading suspension
- No new positions should be initiated in these instruments

## Important Dates

- **Trading Suspension Effective Date**: October 17, 2025
- **Maturity/Redemption Date**: October 23, 2025 (implied from instrument codes)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational notice with limited market impact. The suspension affects only debt segment participants holding or trading these specific T-bills. Investors holding these instruments will receive redemption proceeds on maturity. No broader market implications are expected as this is part of standard debt instrument lifecycle management.
