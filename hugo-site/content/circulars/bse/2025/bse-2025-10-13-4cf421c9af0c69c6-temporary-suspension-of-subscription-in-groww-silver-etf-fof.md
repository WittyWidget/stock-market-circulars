## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to investors in Groww Silver ETF FOF scheme. The suspension prevents new investors from entering the scheme and existing investors from adding to positions during the period when domestic silver prices are at a premium.

**Operational Impact**: Existing systematic investment facilities (SIP, SWP, STP) remain operational. Investors retain full redemption rights, ensuring liquidity is not compromised. The measure protects investors from entering at potentially disadvantageous valuations due to the domestic silver premium.

**Investor Impact**: New subscriptions blocked but existing investments can be redeemed. The temporary nature suggests the fund house expects market conditions to normalize, allowing resumption of subscriptions when domestic-international silver price differential narrows.
