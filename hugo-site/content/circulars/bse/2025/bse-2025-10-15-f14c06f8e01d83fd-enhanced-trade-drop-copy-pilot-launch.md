title: Enhanced Trade Drop Copy â€“ Pilot Launch
---

## Summary

BSE has developed an enhanced trade drop copy solution using the Solace messaging platform to distribute trade data to members. This new facility replicates the traditional drop copy service via ETI protocol with additional enhancements including multiple filtering criteria (Session ID and CP Code). The solution will be launched as a pilot program initially for the Equity Derivatives segment with a maximum of 10 participating members selected on a first-come, first-served basis. The existing trade drop copy facility (circular 20231201-39) will continue to operate without any changes.

## Key Points

- New trade drop copy distribution system built on Solace messaging platform
- Members can connect applications using Solace framework API
- Enhanced filtering capabilities including Session ID and CP Code filters
- Phased rollout starting with pilot program in Equity Derivatives segment only
- Limited to 10 members on first-come, first-served basis
- Existing trade drop copy facility remains unchanged and available
- Participation requires members to develop applications for receiving trade data
- Future expansion to other members/segments depends on pilot performance and usability outcomes

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a new optional technical facility being introduced alongside existing services.

## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates
