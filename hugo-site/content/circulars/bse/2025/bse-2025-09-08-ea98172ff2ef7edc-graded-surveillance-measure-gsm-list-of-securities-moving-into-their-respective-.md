title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving to GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework, moving five securities to different GSM stages. Three companies - Venlon Enterprises Ltd., SC Agrotech Limited, and Ace Engitech Limited - have been moved to GSM Stage I. Two companies - Noida Toll Bridge Company Ltd. and Nivaka Fashions Limited - have been moved to GSM Stage II.

## Key Points

- 5 securities moved to different GSM stages
- 3 securities moved to GSM Stage I (stricter surveillance)
- 2 securities moved to GSM Stage II (highest surveillance level)
- Securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM or IBC frameworks
- Changes aligned with NSE framework where applicable

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of updated GSM stage classifications for the listed securities, involving enhanced surveillance and monitoring measures based on trading patterns and compliance parameters.

## Compliance Requirements

- Securities under GSM Stage I: Enhanced disclosure requirements and stricter price monitoring
- Securities under GSM Stage II: Additional trading restrictions and increased compliance oversight
- Listed companies must ensure compliance with applicable surveillance measures
- Investors should be aware of additional risks associated with GSM securities

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: September 8, 2025
- Circular Release Date: September 8, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities moved to higher GSM stages will face increased trading restrictions and enhanced monitoring. This may result in reduced liquidity and increased volatility for affected stocks.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding these securities should exercise additional caution and monitor compliance developments closely. GSM classification indicates heightened risk factors.

**Market Impact:** Limited overall market impact as only 5 securities are affected, but demonstrates continued regulatory focus on surveillance and risk management.
