## Summary

BSE has issued a circular standardizing penalties for trading member violations discovered during inspections. The framework classifies violations into categories with financial implications, establishing clear penalties for first-time and repeat offenses. Key violations covered include client fund misuse, securities misuse, net worth shortfalls, offering assured returns, and non-cooperation during inspections.

## Key Points

- **Client Fund Violations**: Penalties of 0.07% per day (up to 2 days/month) or 0.10% per day (beyond 2 days) for non-availability or misuse of client funds
- **Securities Misuse**: 2% of misuse amount (max Rs. 1 lakh) for first instance; 3% (max Rs. 2 lakhs) for repeat violations
- **Net Worth Shortfall**: 5% penalty on shortfall amount plus proportional deposit blocking (10%-100% based on severity)
- **Assured Returns**: Disciplinary action including suspension, disablement of terminals, or expulsion
- **Inspection Non-Cooperation**: Daily penalties ranging from Rs. 1,000-5,000 for non-QSB members and Rs. 2,000-10,000 for QSB members

## Regulatory Changes

### Violations with Financial Implications

**1. Client Fund Shortfalls**
- Recouped within timeframe: 0.07%-0.10% daily penalty on shortfall amount
- Not recouped after 30 days: Referral for disciplinary action, terminal disablement, new client restrictions
- Proprietary deposits blocked up to shortfall amount or Rs. 10 crores (whichever lower) for 10 days

**2. Client Securities/Commodities Misuse**
- First instance: 2% of misuse amount (capped at Rs. 1 lakh)
- Repeat instances: 3% of misuse amount (capped at Rs. 2 lakhs)

**3. Net Worth Shortfall**
- Monetary penalty: 5% of shortfall from required net worth
- Deposit blocking based on severity:
  - Up to 10% shortfall: 10% blocking
  - 10%-20% shortfall: 25% blocking
  - 20%-50% shortfall: 50% blocking
  - Over 50% shortfall: 100% blocking
- Repeat violations: 50% escalation plus administrative recoupment action

**4. Fixed/Assured Returns**
- Disciplinary action including no new clients, suspension/disablement, or expulsion

**5. Inspection Data Submission**
- Non-cooperation penalties escalate from Rs. 1,000-5,000/day (non-QSB) or Rs. 2,000-10,000/day (QSB)
- Maximum penalties: Rs. 1 lakh (non-QSB) or Rs. 2 lakhs (QSB) before member committee referral

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must maintain adequate client funds and avoid misuse for proprietary trading
- Maintain minimum prescribed net worth at all times and report accurately
- Prohibit offering fixed/assured/periodic returns or mobilizing deposits from investors
- Full cooperation required during inspections with timely submission of all requested documents/data
- Accurate data submission mandatory; material misrepresentation subject to penalties
- Recoup any shortfalls promptly to avoid escalated penalties and disciplinary action

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 10, 2025 (circular issuance date)
- **Client Fund Shortfall Timeline**: 30 days continuous shortfall triggers disciplinary referral
- **Deposit Blocking Timeline**: 2 trading days notice before blocking proprietary deposits
- **Blocking Duration**: 10 days for blocked proprietary deposits/collaterals
- **Inspection Data Submission**: 7-day threshold for penalty escalation

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Trading members face standardized, transparent penalty framework reducing regulatory uncertainty. Clear escalation paths for repeat violations incentivize compliance. Non-cooperation during inspections carries substantial daily penalties that can reach Rs. 1-2 lakhs before committee referral.

**Financial Impact**: Material violations carry significant financial consequences including percentage-based penalties on misuse amounts, deposit blocking proportional to net worth shortfalls, and potential terminal disablement affecting revenue generation. QSB members face double penalties compared to non-QSB members for inspection-related violations.

**Compliance Impact**: Standardization brings clarity but requires robust internal controls to prevent client fund/securities misuse, accurate net worth reporting, and inspection readiness. Members must ensure data systems can produce required records promptly to avoid daily penalties.
