title: 'Sub-Division of Equity Shares of STEELCAST LTD (Scrip Code: 513517)'
---

## Summary

STEELCAST LTD (Scrip Code: 513517) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of face value Rs. 5 will be sub-divided into five equity shares of face value Re. 1 each, effective August 29, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: STEELCAST LTD (Scrip Code: 513517)
- Record date: August 29, 2025
- Sub-division ratio: 1:5 (one Rs. 5 share becomes five Re. 1 shares)
- Effective date: August 29, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE124E01020) for Rs. 5 paid-up shares will become invalid
- New ISIN for Re. 1 paid-up shares to be announced separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE124E01020 for Rs. 5 paid-up equity shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after August 29, 2025. A new ISIN number for the Re. 1 paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate market notice.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the record date and ensure proper handling of the sub-divided shares. All transactions involving the old ISIN will cease to be valid from the effective date.

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: August 29, 2025
- **Effective Date**: August 29, 2025
- **ISIN Validity Cutoff**: August 29, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This corporate action will increase the number of shares outstanding by a factor of five while reducing the face value proportionally. The sub-division may improve liquidity and make shares more accessible to retail investors due to lower absolute price per share.
