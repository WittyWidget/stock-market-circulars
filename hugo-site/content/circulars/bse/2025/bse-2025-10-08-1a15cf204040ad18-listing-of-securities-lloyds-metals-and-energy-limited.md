## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The listing adds 3.1 million shares to the tradable float of Lloyds Metals and Energy Limited, though these shares remain locked-in for approximately 6.5 months from the listing date. This represents equity dilution for existing shareholders.

**Capital Raising:** The preferential allotment raised approximately Rs. 229.4 crores (3.1 million shares Ã— Rs. 740 per share) for the company, indicating capital infusion for business operations or expansion.

**Liquidity Impact:** While the shares are listed, the lock-in period until April 30, 2026 means they cannot be traded until then, limiting immediate impact on stock liquidity. Post lock-in expiry, the additional supply could affect share price dynamics.

**Investor Consideration:** The warrant conversion mechanism and preferential allotment to non-promoters suggests strategic investor participation at a premium price, which may be viewed positively by the market.
