  September 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective September 1, 2025. The circular details securities being newly included in LT-ASM, securities moving between different ASM stages, and securities exiting the framework. The changes affect 26 securities across various surveillance categories.

## Key Points

- 5 securities newly shortlisted for Long Term ASM Framework
- 2 securities moved to higher ASM stages (Bharat Global Developers to Stage III, Cargosol Logistics to Stage II)
- 5 securities moved to lower ASM stages (all moved to Stage I)
- 9 securities removed from Long Term ASM Framework
- No securities directly placed in Stage IV Long Term ASM
- Changes effective from September 1, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of revised Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure framework
- Updated categorization of securities under different ASM stages
- Enhanced surveillance measures for identified securities
- Removal of certain securities due to inclusion in other frameworks (Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, IBC)

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with enhanced surveillance requirements for securities in LT-ASM
- Trading members need to ensure adherence to specific trading conditions for affected securities
- Brokers must inform clients about securities under surveillance measures
- Compliance with margin and settlement requirements for ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **September 1, 2025**: Effective date for all LT-ASM framework changes
- All securities movements between stages become applicable from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects trading liquidity and investor participation for 26 securities across different market segments. Securities under higher ASM stages face additional trading restrictions which may impact price discovery and volumes.

**Operational Impact**: Trading systems and risk management frameworks need updates to accommodate new surveillance categories and stage movements. Brokers must update client communication and risk monitoring systems for affected securities.
