## Impact Assessment

This rights issue significantly increases the share capital of Mehai Technology Limited with 370.53 million new shares. The relatively low issue price of Re. 2/- per share (Re. 1/- face value + Re. 1/- premium) indicates a discounted offering to existing shareholders. The large volume of shares may impact liquidity and could result in dilution for shareholders who did not participate in the rights issue. Market participants should note the expanded share base when evaluating the company's market capitalization and trading activity.
