## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects 17 securities with varying degrees of trading restrictions. Tighter price bands will reduce intraday volatility but may impact liquidity.

**Trading Impact:** Securities with 2% bands will experience significant trading constraints, potentially leading to reduced volumes. The 20% bands on Sampat Aluminium and VMS TMT suggest recent volatility concerns.

**Investor Impact:** Investors in affected securities will face limited price movement within trading sessions, requiring multi-day periods for significant price discovery. Day traders and short-term speculators will find reduced opportunities in these scrips.
