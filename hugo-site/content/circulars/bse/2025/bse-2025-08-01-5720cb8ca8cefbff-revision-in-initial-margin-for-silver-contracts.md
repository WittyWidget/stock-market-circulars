## Summary

BSE has revised the minimum initial margin for all variants of silver contracts, reducing it from 11.50% to 10.00%. This change modifies the previous circular dated July 23, 2025, and will be effective from August 5, 2025.

## Key Points

- Minimum Initial Margin reduced from 11.50% to 10.00%
- Short Option Minimum Margin (SOMM) set at 10.00%
- Applicable MPOR (Margin Period of Risk) remains at 3 days
- Applicable VSR (Volatility Scanning Range) remains at 6%
- Initial margin will be higher of minimum initial margin or VaR scaled up by MPOR

## Regulatory Changes

Revision of margin parameters for silver contracts:
- Previous minimum initial margin: 11.50%
- New minimum initial margin: 10.00%
- SOMM maintained at 10.00%
- MPOR and VSR parameters unchanged

## Compliance Requirements

- All members and participants must implement the revised margin parameters
- Initial margin calculation must use the higher of minimum initial margin or VaR scaled up by MPOR
- Members should update their risk management systems accordingly

## Important Dates

- **August 5, 2025**: Effective date for revised margin parameters (Begin of Day)
- **July 23, 2025**: Date of previous circular being modified

## Impact Assessment

The margin reduction will:
- Lower capital requirements for silver contract trading
- Potentially increase trading activity in silver derivatives
- Reduce trading costs for market participants
- Maintain adequate risk coverage through VaR-based calculations
