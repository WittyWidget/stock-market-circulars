title: Add-on Price Band Framework - Updated List of Securities
---

## Summary

BSE has published an updated list of 38 securities that are subject to the Add-on Price Band Framework, a surveillance measure designed to control excessive price volatility. This framework applies additional price restrictions beyond normal daily price limits for securities that exhibit unusual trading patterns or volatility.

## Key Points

- 38 securities are currently under the Add-on Price Band Framework
- List includes companies across various sectors and market capitalizations
- Framework acts as an additional surveillance measure beyond regular price bands
- Securities range from established companies to smaller enterprises
- Both equity shares and other securities are included in the surveillance list

## Regulatory Changes

This is an updated list reflecting the current securities under surveillance. The Add-on Price Band Framework is an existing regulatory mechanism, and this circular provides the latest compilation of affected securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of additional price band restrictions on these securities
- Enhanced monitoring and surveillance applies to trading in these securities
- Regular review and updates of the surveillance list by BSE
- Market participants should factor in additional price constraints when trading

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: September 1, 2025
- Framework remains in effect until further notice
- Regular updates to the list as market conditions change

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact:** Securities on this list face additional price movement restrictions, potentially limiting intraday volatility and affecting trading strategies. Market participants need to adjust their trading approaches for these securities.

**Market Operations:** Enhanced surveillance helps maintain market integrity but may reduce liquidity in affected securities. The framework serves as a protective measure for investors while allowing continued trading within controlled parameters.
