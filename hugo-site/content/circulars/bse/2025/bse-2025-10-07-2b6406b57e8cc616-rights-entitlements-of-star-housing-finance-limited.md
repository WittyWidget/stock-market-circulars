## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects existing shareholders of STAR HOUSING FINANCE LIMITED who can trade their rights entitlements during the specified period. Provides liquidity option for shareholders who do not wish to participate in the rights issue.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure proper disclosure mechanisms, update systems for RE trading with specified ISIN, and educate clients about the difference between REs and ordinary shares. The trade-for-trade settlement reduces systemic risk but requires specific operational handling.
