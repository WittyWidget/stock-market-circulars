- Penalties differentiate between first-time and repeat violations
- Client fund misuse penalties range from 0.07% to 0.10% per day depending on duration
- Proprietary deposits may be blocked up to Rs. 10 crores for fund shortfalls
- Securities misuse attracts 2-3% penalty with caps of Rs. 1-2 lakhs
- Net worth shortfall penalties at 5% of shortfall amount with progressive deposit blocking
- Daily penalties for non-submission of inspection documents
- Different penalty rates for QSB (Qualified Stock Broker) and non-QSB members

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This standardized penalty framework affects all BSE Trading Members and establishes clear consequences for violations, promoting market integrity and investor protection.
