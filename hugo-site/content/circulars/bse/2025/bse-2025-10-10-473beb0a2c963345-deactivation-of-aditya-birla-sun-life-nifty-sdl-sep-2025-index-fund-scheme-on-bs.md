title: Deactivation of ADITYA BIRLA SUN LIFE NIFTY SDL SEP 2025 INDEX FUND scheme
  on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

BSE has deactivated the ADITYA BIRLA SUN LIFE NIFTY SDL SEP 2025 INDEX FUND scheme on the BSE StAR MF Platform with immediate effect. The scheme matured and closed in September 2025, making further creation, cancellation, or redemption of units impossible at the AMC/RTA level. All existing SIP/XSIP/STP/SWP registrations in this scheme will be cancelled by the exchange immediately.

## Key Points

- ADITYA BIRLA SUN LIFE NIFTY SDL SEP 2025 INDEX FUND scheme has been deactivated on BSE StAR MF platform
- Scheme matured and closed in September 2025
- No further Creation/Cancellation/Redemption of units available at AMC/RTA end
- All existing SIP/XSIP/STP/SWP registrations in the scheme will be cancelled by BSE with immediate effect
- Deactivation effective immediately from October 10, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is an operational notification regarding scheme lifecycle completion.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must note that the scheme is no longer available for trading on BSE StAR MF platform
- No action required from members as BSE will automatically cancel existing systematic investment plans
- Members should inform clients holding SIP/XSIP/STP/SWP in this scheme about automatic cancellation

## Important Dates

- **Scheme Maturity and Closure**: September 2025
- **Deactivation Effective Date**: October 10, 2025 (immediate effect)
- **SIP/XSIP/STP/SWP Cancellation**: October 10, 2025 (immediate effect)

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Investors with existing systematic investment plans (SIP/XSIP/STP/SWP) in this scheme will have their registrations automatically cancelled. As the scheme has already matured, investors should have received their maturity proceeds in September 2025.

**Operational Impact**: Limited to investors and distributors who had active systematic plans in this specific scheme. No new investments were possible post-maturity, so the deactivation formalizes the scheme's closure on the platform.

**Market Impact**: Minimal, as this is a single matured index fund scheme focused on State Development Loans (SDL) with a fixed maturity date. The closure was planned and expected based on the scheme's structure.
