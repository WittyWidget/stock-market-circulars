- **October 18, 2025**: Record date for determining shareholders eligible for sub-division
- **New ISIN**: To be announced via separate notice

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The 1:5 stock split will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the share price proportionally. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Trading Impact**: All trading systems must be updated before October 17, 2025. The old ISIN will be deactivated, requiring transition to the new ISIN for continued trading.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. Total investment value remains unchanged, only the number of shares and price per share changes.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers, depositories, and trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value, ISIN, and adjusted share quantities.
