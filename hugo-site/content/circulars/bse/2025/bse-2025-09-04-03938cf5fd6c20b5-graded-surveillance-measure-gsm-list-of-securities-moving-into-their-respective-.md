title: GSM Framework Updates - Three Securities Move to Different Surveillance Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of three securities to different stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. This regulatory action affects Quadrant Televentures Limited, Sparkle Gold Rock Limited, and Yaari Digital Integrated Services Ltd, with each moving to progressively higher surveillance stages.

## Key Points

- Quadrant Televentures Limited (Security Code: 511116, ISIN: INE527B01020) moves to GSM Stage I
- Sparkle Gold Rock Limited (Security Code: 530037, ISIN: INE618F01010) moves to GSM Stage II
- Yaari Digital Integrated Services Ltd (Security Code: 533520, ISIN: INE126M01010) moves to GSM Stage III (as per NSE)
- Securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM or IBC frameworks

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures with increasing restrictions at each stage. Higher GSM stages typically involve additional margin requirements, price bands, and trading restrictions designed to protect investors from excessive volatility.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors trading in these securities must comply with enhanced surveillance requirements
- Additional margin requirements may apply based on the GSM stage
- Price discovery mechanisms may be subject to enhanced monitoring
- Trading members must ensure compliance with stage-specific trading conditions

## Important Dates

- Circular issued: September 4, 2025
- Implementation: Immediate effect from circular date

## Impact Assessment

The movement of these securities to higher GSM stages indicates regulatory concerns about their trading patterns or corporate governance. This could result in reduced liquidity, higher trading costs for investors, and increased volatility controls. Investors should exercise additional caution when trading these securities and be aware of the enhanced surveillance measures in place.
