## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Multiple high-profile companies are involved, particularly TCS and HCL Technologies which are major index constituents. The dividend announcements may influence short-term trading activity.

**SLB Operations Impact:** Medium - The shut periods will temporarily restrict securities lending and borrowing activities for these securities. Market participants with active SLB positions must plan accordingly.

**Investor Impact:** Low to Medium - Investors holding these securities in the SLB segment need to be aware of the shut periods. The BEML stock split may generate increased trading interest and improve liquidity post-split.

**Operational Impact:** Low - Standard corporate action processing applies. Market infrastructure providers must update systems to reflect these actions during the specified periods.
