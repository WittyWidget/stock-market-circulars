This follows the exchange's notice dated October 7, 2025, and represents a standard post-IPO transition for the SME company.

## Key Points

- Company: VALPLAST TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED (SME IPO)
- Scrip Code: 544565
- Current Segment: Trade for Trade (MT Group)
- New Segment: Rolling segment (M Group)
- Effective Date: October 24, 2025

- Contact: Mr. Anurag Jain, Tel: 022-2272 8822

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for VALPLAST TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED will change from Trade for Trade settlement to Rolling settlement. This is a typical progression for SME IPO companies after their listing period, allowing for more flexible trading with T+2 settlement instead of compulsory delivery-based trading.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members should adjust their systems to accommodate the group change from MT to M Group
- Members must update trading protocols for rolling settlement mechanism
- For clarifications, trading members should contact Mr. Anurag Jain at the provided contact number

## Important Dates

- **October 7, 2025**: Original notice issued (Notice No. 20251007-55)
- **October 8, 2025**: Confirmation notice issued
- **October 24, 2025**: Effective date for group change and trading segment transfer

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The shift from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment typically increases liquidity and trading volumes as it removes the compulsory delivery requirement. Investors will be able to engage in intraday trading and benefit from T+2 settlement cycles.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems and processes to reflect the new trading mechanism. The transition is routine for SME IPO companies and indicates the company has completed its initial listing requirements under the Trade for Trade framework.

**Investor Impact**: Positive - Enhanced liquidity and flexibility for investors, though it also introduces higher volatility potential compared to the controlled Trade for Trade environment.
