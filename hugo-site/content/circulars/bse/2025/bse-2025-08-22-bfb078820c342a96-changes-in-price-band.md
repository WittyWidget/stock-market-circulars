title: Changes in Price Band - 102 Securities Revised Effective August 25, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced changes in price bands for 102 securities effective August 25, 2025. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, with most securities having a 5% price band limit. This measure affects trading parameters and volatility controls for these securities.

## Key Points

- 102 securities will have revised price bands effective August 25, 2025
- Price band percentages range from 2% to 20%
- Most securities (majority) are set to 5% price band
- Some high-risk securities have 20% price bands
- Few securities have restrictive 2% price bands
- Changes apply to equity segment trading

## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions represent enhanced surveillance measures to control excessive volatility in specific securities. The differentiated approach with varying percentages indicates risk-based categorization of securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with new price band limits
- Orders exceeding the revised price bands will be rejected
- Risk management systems must be updated to reflect new parameters
- Market surveillance will monitor adherence to revised bands

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 25, 2025
- **Notice Date**: August 22, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The price band changes will impact trading dynamics for affected securities by limiting intraday price movements. Securities with tighter bands (2%) will have reduced volatility, while those with wider bands (20%) allow for greater price discovery. This measure enhances market stability while maintaining liquidity for legitimate trading activities.
