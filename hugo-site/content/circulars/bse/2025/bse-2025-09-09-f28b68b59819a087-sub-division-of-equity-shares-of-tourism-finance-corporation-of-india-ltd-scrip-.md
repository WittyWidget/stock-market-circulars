- Sub-division ratio: 1 share of Rs. 10 becomes 5 shares of Rs. 2 each
- Current ISIN (INE305A01015) for Rs. 10 shares becomes invalid from September 19, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE305A01015 for Rs. 10 paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after September 19, 2025. A new ISIN number for the Rs. 2 paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate notice.
