## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine listing of preferential allotment shares to promoters following warrant conversion. The shares are subject to a lock-in period of approximately 1.5 years, preventing immediate market circulation.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - Trading members need to be aware of the new securities and associated lock-in restrictions. The shares will increase the total outstanding equity of Hubtown Limited but are not immediately tradable due to lock-in provisions.

**Liquidity Impact:** None in the short term due to complete lock-in until May 2027. Post lock-in expiry, this represents approximately 1.58 crore shares that could potentially enter the tradable float.
