## Important Dates

- **October 21, 2025**: Record date for part redemption and interest payment eligibility

## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market-wide impact as it pertains to privately placed debentures of a single issuer. The part redemption is a routine corporate action that benefits debenture holders through partial capital return and interest payment. Trading members dealing in debt securities need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face value. The 11.75% coupon rate debentures maturing on August 5, 2027 will continue trading at the reduced face value going forward.
