title: Guidelines for SEBI KYC Registration Agency Regulations Amendment and Client
  Validation Requirements
---

## Summary

BSE issues guidelines following SEBI's amendment to KYC Registration Agency Regulations, introducing strict validation requirements for client trading. Clients with non-validated KYC from August 1-31, 2025 will face trading restrictions from September 22, 2025.

## Key Points

- KRAs will report deceased investor PANs daily for account blocking
- Trading members must block debit transactions for deceased investor accounts
- Clients with "On Hold" KYC status from August 1-31, 2025 cannot trade from September 22, 2025
- Non-compliant PANs flagged as "Not Permitted to Trade" from September 20, 2025
- Compliant clients can resume trading on T+1 basis after validation
- List of non-compliant clients provided in specified file path

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of centralized mechanism for reporting investor demise through KRAs
- Enhanced KYC validation requirements with trading restrictions for non-compliance
- Daily reporting system for deceased investor PANs
- Automated flagging system for non-validated KYC accounts

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must block debit transactions for deceased investor accounts based on daily KRA reports
- Inactivate/close UCC in all stock exchanges for deceased investors
- Ensure clients with non-validated KYC cannot trade until compliance achieved
- Monitor daily KRA communications for compliance updates
- Contact BSE at 022-2272 8435/5785 or ucc@bseindia.com for clarifications

## Important Dates

- August 1-31, 2025: Period for KYC uploads subject to new validation requirements
- September 20, 2025: Non-compliant PANs flagged as "Not Permitted to Trade"
- September 22, 2025: Trading restrictions effective for non-validated KYC clients
- T+1 basis: Compliant clients permitted to trade after validation

## Impact Assessment

High impact on market operations as clients with non-validated KYC face complete trading restrictions. Open positions for non-compliant clients will naturally expire on contract expiry dates. Enhanced compliance burden on trading members for daily monitoring and account management based on KRA reports.
