title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework Updates - Securities List Changes
---

## Summary

BSE has announced updates to the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework effective August 28, 2025. Three new securities are being added to the ESM framework, while 13 existing securities will be moved to higher ESM stages. No securities are moving to lower stages or exiting the framework.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities added to ESM framework: IZMO Ltd, Oceanic Foods Ltd, Subam Papers Ltd
- 13 securities moved to higher ESM stages including AGS Transact Technologies, Containerway International, and others
- No securities moving to lower ESM stages or exiting the framework
- Changes effective from August 28, 2025
- Consolidated list shows 21+ securities currently under ESM framework across different stages

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework continues to be applied as a surveillance measure for securities that exhibit abnormal price movements or trading patterns. Securities are classified into different ESM stages (I, II, etc.) with varying levels of surveillance and trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with enhanced surveillance requirements for listed securities
- Additional margin requirements and position limits may apply
- Stricter monitoring of trading activities in these securities
- Regular compliance reporting as per ESM framework guidelines

## Important Dates

- **August 28, 2025**: Effective date for all ESM framework changes
- Securities will be subject to enhanced surveillance measures from this date

## Impact Assessment

The addition of new securities and elevation of existing ones to higher ESM stages indicates continued market surveillance efforts. This may result in reduced liquidity and increased trading costs for affected securities. Investors should exercise additional caution when trading in ESM securities due to enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions.
