**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium for BSE StAR MF platform members - Members need to follow standard NFO procedures including fund settlement timelines, transaction cancellation protocols for unfunded orders, and extended trading hours management. The clear funds deadline and switch transaction rules require operational attention during the NFO period.
