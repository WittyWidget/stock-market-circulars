## Summary

BSE has announced a new ISIN number for Gokul Agro Resources Ltd (Scrip Code: 539725) following the sub-division of equity shares. The new ISIN INE314T01033 will replace the old ISIN for equity shares with revised face value of Re.1/- each (sub-divided from Rs.2/-). The change will be effective for trades executed on and from October 14, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: Gokul Agro Resources Ltd
- Scrip Code: 539725
- New ISIN: INE314T01033
- Corporate Action: Sub-Division of Equity Shares
- Old Face Value: Rs.2/- per share
- New Face Value: Re.1/- per share
- Effective Date: October 14, 2025 (Ex-Date)
- Document Reference: DR-735/2025-2026
- Continuation of Notice: 20250923-68 dated September 23, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard corporate action notification pursuant to the company's previously announced sub-division of equity shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN INE314T01033 for all trades in Gokul Agro Resources Ltd equity shares from October 14, 2025 onwards
- Systems must be updated to reflect the new ISIN and revised face value of Re.1/- per share
- The sub-division ratio is 1:2 (each share of Rs.2/- split into 2 shares of Re.1/-)

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 7, 2025
- **Ex-Date**: October 14, 2025 (new ISIN becomes effective for trading)
- **Original Notice Reference**: September 23, 2025 (Notice No. 20250923-68)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The ISIN change is a technical update following a corporate action that doubles the number of shares while halving the face value. This will affect:

- Trading systems that need to recognize the new ISIN
- Demat accounts where shares will be credited with the new ISIN
- Market data providers requiring ISIN mapping updates
- Price discovery as the stock price will adjust proportionately

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their holdings doubled in quantity with the new ISIN, but the total investment value remains unchanged. The lower price per share post-split may improve liquidity and attract retail investors.
