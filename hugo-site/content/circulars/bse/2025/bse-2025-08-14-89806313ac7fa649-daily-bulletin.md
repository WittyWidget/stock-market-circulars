## Compliance Requirements

- Shareholders must hold shares on record dates to be eligible for dividends
- Trading flag set to 1 for all securities during record date periods
- Debenture holders eligible for interest payments based on record dates
- Commercial paper holders must hold securities on redemption record dates

## Impact Assessment

Moderate impact on trading activity as multiple securities will trade ex-dividend/ex-interest around record dates. Significant dividend announcements include Balmer Lawrie (430% dividend) and Astra Microwave (110% dividend). Stock split by Chandrima Mercantiles will increase share count 10-fold while proportionally reducing share price.
