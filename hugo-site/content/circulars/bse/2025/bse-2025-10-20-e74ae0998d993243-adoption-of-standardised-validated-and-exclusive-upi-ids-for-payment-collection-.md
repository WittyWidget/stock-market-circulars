title: Adoption of Standardised, Validated and Exclusive UPI IDs for Payment Collection
  by SEBI Registered Intermediaries from Investors
---

## Summary

SEBI has mandated that all registered intermediaries must adopt standardised, validated and exclusive UPI IDs for collecting payments from investors. This directive aims to enhance the security of payment collection processes and prevent fraudulent activities by ensuring that only verified and dedicated UPI IDs are used for investor transactions.

## Key Points

- All SEBI registered intermediaries must implement standardised UPI ID formats for payment collection
- UPI IDs must be validated and registered with the intermediary's official records
- Exclusive UPI IDs should be maintained specifically for investor payment collections
- This measure enhances investor protection and reduces the risk of payment fraud
- Intermediaries need to update their payment systems and processes to comply

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has introduced new requirements for payment collection mechanisms:

- Mandatory adoption of standardised UPI ID naming conventions
- Validation requirements for all UPI IDs used for investor payment collection
- Exclusive use of dedicated UPI IDs (not to be shared with other business purposes)
- Enhanced security protocols for payment processing

## Compliance Requirements

- SEBI registered intermediaries (brokers, investment advisors, portfolio managers, etc.) must implement standardised UPI IDs
- Existing UPI IDs must be validated and updated to meet the new standards
- Payment collection systems must be configured to accept only validated UPI IDs
- Intermediaries must maintain proper records of validated UPI IDs
- Communication to investors about the official UPI IDs to be used for payments

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: October 20, 2025
- Implementation timeline to be specified by SEBI or immediately effective
