## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Forces closure of all existing derivative positions in Tata Motors before the ex-date, potentially causing significant volatility and liquidity pressure on October 13, 2025.

**Trading Impact**: All market participants with Tata Motors F&O positions must exit or roll their positions before October 13, 2025. Gap in derivatives trading availability until new contracts are introduced.

**Operational Impact**: Traders and risk managers need to recalibrate hedging strategies. The special pre-open session on October 14 will determine strike prices for new contracts, creating pricing uncertainty.

**Strategic Considerations**: Options sellers face assignment risk, futures holders must close positions, and algorithmic traders need to update their systems for the contract discontinuity.
