## Impact Assessment

**Liquidity Impact:** Significant reduction in trading volumes expected as intraday traders will exit these securities. Historical data shows T2T securities experience 60-80% drop in trading activity.

**Investor Impact:** Retail and institutional investors engaged in short-term trading strategies will be unable to execute intraday positions. Only delivery-based investors can participate.

**Price Discovery:** Limited price discovery due to reduced participation and 5% price band restriction. Volatility may increase at band limits.

**Market Surveillance:** This action indicates BSE has identified unusual price movements, volatility, or other concerns warranting enhanced surveillance through T2T classification.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers must update risk management systems, block intraday orders, and ensure 100% margin collection for these securities. Failure to comply may result in penalties.
