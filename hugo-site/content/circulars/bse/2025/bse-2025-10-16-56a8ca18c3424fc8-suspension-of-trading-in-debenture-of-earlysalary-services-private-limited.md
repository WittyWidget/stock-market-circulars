## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This affects a single private company debenture series with limited trading activity. The suspension is temporary and related to a scheduled corporate action.

**Investor Impact**: Low to medium for debenture holders. Those holding the debentures will receive their redemption proceeds and interest payment. However, investors cannot trade these securities from October 20, 2025.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine suspension that trading members regularly handle as part of corporate action processing. Systems need to be updated to block trading in the specified ISIN.
