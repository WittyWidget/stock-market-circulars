title: BSE GSM List - Securities Moving to Surveillance Stages (July 25, 2025)
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 6 securities into different stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. The securities are being moved to GSM Stages I, II, and III based on specific criteria. Two securities (Ashish Polyplast Ltd. and MT Educare Ltd.) are moving to Stage I, one security (Oscar Global Ltd.) to Stage II, and three securities (Neelkanth Limited, Saptarishi Agro Industries Ltd, and Golden Carpets Ltd.) to Stage III.

## Key Points

- 6 securities are being moved to various GSM stages effective immediately
- Stage I: Ashish Polyplast Ltd. (530429) and MT Educare Ltd. (534312)
- Stage II: Oscar Global Ltd. (530173)
- Stage III: Neelkanth Limited (512565), Saptarishi Agro Industries Ltd (519238), and Golden Carpets Ltd. (531928)
- MT Educare Ltd. classification follows NSE guidelines
- Securities under GSM face increased surveillance and trading restrictions

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework implementation involves progressive surveillance measures where securities are classified into different stages based on risk assessment criteria. Higher GSM stages typically involve stricter trading conditions and enhanced monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with additional surveillance requirements for these securities
- Trading in these securities will be subject to GSM stage-specific restrictions
- Investors should be aware of the enhanced surveillance status when trading these securities

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: July 25, 2025 (as per circular publication)
- Implementation: Immediate upon circular release

## Impact Assessment

The GSM classification affects trading liquidity and investor sentiment for the listed securities. Stage III securities face the most restrictive trading conditions, while Stage I securities have relatively lighter surveillance measures. Investors and market participants should exercise increased caution when dealing with these securities and be aware of the potential for additional volatility or trading restrictions.
