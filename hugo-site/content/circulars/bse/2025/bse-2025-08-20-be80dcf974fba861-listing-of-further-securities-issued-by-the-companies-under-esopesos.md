- Total shares being listed: 1,648,693 shares across all companies
- Effective trading date: August 21, 2025
- Face values range from ₹2 to ₹10 per share
- Only one company (Transcorp International) has shares under lock-in period until July 30, 2026
- All other companies have no lock-in restrictions (marked as "NA")

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced in this circular.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed about the new securities admission for trading
- Companies must ensure proper listing compliance for ESOP/ESOS issued shares
- Lock-in period compliance required for Transcorp International shares

## Important Dates

- **August 21, 2025**: Effective date for trading of newly listed ESOP/ESOS shares
