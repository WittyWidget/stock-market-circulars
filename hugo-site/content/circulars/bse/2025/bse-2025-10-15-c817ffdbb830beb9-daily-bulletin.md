## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Multiple dividend announcements will result in ex-date price adjustments for affected securities. The substantial dividend from Ksolves India (100% or Rs. 5 per share) may see notable trading activity around the record date.

**Investor Impact:** Investors must hold shares before the ex-date (typically one trading day before record date) to be eligible for announced dividends. Those trading around these dates should factor in ex-dividend price adjustments.

**Operational Impact:** Moderate operational activity for market infrastructure including exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories, and registrar & transfer agents to process entitlements and distributions.

**Debt Market Impact:** Regular debt servicing events indicate normal functioning of corporate debt market with scheduled interest payments and CP redemptions maintaining investor confidence in debt instruments.
