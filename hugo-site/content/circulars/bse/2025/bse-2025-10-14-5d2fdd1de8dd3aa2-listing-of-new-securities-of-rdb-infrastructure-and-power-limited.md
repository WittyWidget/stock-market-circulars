| 1,75,50,000 | 172834001 to 190384000 | April 30, 2027 |
| 72,50,000 | 190384001 to 197634000 | April 30, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The listing of 2.48 crore shares represents a significant addition to the outstanding shares of RDB Infrastructure and Power Limited. However, the substantial lock-in provisions (1.755 crore shares locked until April 2027, and 72.5 lakh shares until April 2026) will limit immediate trading float impact.

**Trading Impact**: The locked-in nature of most shares means limited immediate supply in the secondary market. Only shares allotted outside this preferential issue will be freely tradable.

**Investor Consideration**: Investors should note the warrant conversion nature of this allotment and the extended lock-in periods, which indicate promoter/strategic investor commitment but also potential future supply when lock-ins expire.
