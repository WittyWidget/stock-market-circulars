## Impact Assessment

The listing has minimal market impact as it involves a relatively small number of shares (5,00,000) issued on a preferential basis. The entire issue is subject to lock-in until April 30, 2026, preventing immediate trading and limiting potential price volatility. This is a routine corporate action involving warrant conversion by non-promoters. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and new distinctive numbers.
