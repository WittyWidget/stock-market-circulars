**Operational Impact**: Low to moderate for BSE members and brokers who will need to process NFO transactions during the specified period and ensure compliance with fund transfer timelines.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors seeking exposure to equity investments outside the top 100 stocks through a long-short strategy via a Specialized Investment Fund structure. The availability of both Regular and Direct plans with multiple payout options provides flexibility.
