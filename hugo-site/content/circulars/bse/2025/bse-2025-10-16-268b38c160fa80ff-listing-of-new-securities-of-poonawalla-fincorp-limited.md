## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The preferential allotment of approximately 3.31 crore shares to promoters represents a significant equity issuance that will increase the company's equity capital base. The issue price of Rs. 452.51/- per share indicates a total fund raise of approximately Rs. 1,499 crores.

**Shareholder Impact**: The preferential allotment to promoters will increase promoter holding percentage while diluting existing non-promoter shareholders. However, the 18-month lock-in period provides stability by preventing immediate selling pressure from promoters.

**Liquidity Impact**: The shares will be locked-in until April 2027, meaning they will not contribute to free float or trading liquidity during this period. Post lock-in expiry, there may be increased supply in the market.

**Company Impact**: Substantial capital infusion strengthens the company's capital base, potentially supporting business expansion, debt reduction, or other corporate purposes as disclosed in the preferential allotment documents.
