## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 99 different securities, indicating delivery failures across multiple stocks. The presence of large quantities in some scrips (especially Enbee Trade with 283,046 shares) suggests significant settlement issues.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers who failed to deliver shares will need to purchase them through the auction at potentially higher prices, resulting in financial losses. Investors may experience delays in receiving their securities.

**Investor Impact:** Medium - While routine, demat auctions indicate operational issues in settlement and can lead to price volatility in affected securities during the auction period.
