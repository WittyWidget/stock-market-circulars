## Impact Assessment

This is a routine commercial paper listing for short-term funding requirements of Grasim Industries Ltd. The impact is minimal as it represents standard treasury operations for a large corporate. The high credit ratings (A1+ from both CARE and ICRA) indicate strong creditworthiness. The 50-day tenure suggests this is for working capital or short-term liquidity management. No material impact on broader market operations or investor portfolios is anticipated.
