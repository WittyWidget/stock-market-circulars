## Key Points

- Company: Grihum Housing Finance Limited
- Debenture Code: GHF-RESET RATE-27-9-28-PVT
- ISIN: INE055I07180 (975116)

- Effective date: September 11, 2025
- Settlement number: DR-713/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action process for debenture part redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the reduced face value effective from September 11, 2025
- All trading in these debentures must reflect the new face value of Rs. 60,000 per debenture
- Settlement procedures to follow DR-713/2025-2026 guidelines

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact limited to holders of Grihum Housing Finance debentures. The part redemption reduces the face value by 40%, which affects the nominal value of holdings but provides partial cash return to investors. Trading systems and member records need updating to reflect the new face value for accurate settlement and valuation.
