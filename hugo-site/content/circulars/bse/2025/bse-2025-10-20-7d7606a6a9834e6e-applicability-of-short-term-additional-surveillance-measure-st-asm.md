## Regulatory Framework

The Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) is applied to securities showing unusual price movements or volume variations over short periods (5/15/30 days). Securities can be:

- Moved to higher stage ASM for continued unusual activity
- Moved to lower stage ASM for improvement
- Moved out to other frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM, GSM, Trade-for-Trade, or Pledge Framework)
- Subject to enhanced surveillance and trading restrictions

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should note the securities moving out of ST-ASM framework
- Trading members must update their surveillance systems accordingly
- Investors should be aware that securities remaining in ST-ASM are subject to additional surveillance measures
- SME scrips and T+0 scrips may have special considerations as marked in the circular

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 21, 2025
- Changes to ST-ASM framework applicable from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The removal of 9 securities from ST-ASM framework indicates either improved trading behavior or movement to more stringent surveillance frameworks. No new additions suggest stable market conditions for most securities.

**Trading Impact**: Securities moving out of ST-ASM may see changes in trading restrictions depending on their destination framework (LT-ASM or ESM have different requirements). Securities remaining in ST-ASM continue to face enhanced surveillance measures including possible price bands, trading frequency limits, or margin requirements.

**Investor Consideration**: Investors holding securities in ST-ASM framework should monitor for compliance with surveillance measures and be aware of potential liquidity constraints.
