## Summary

SEBI has issued an ex-parte interim order under Sections 11 and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 against 8 entities for alleged insider trading in the scrip of Indian Energy Exchange Limited (IEX). The action stems from a suo-motu preliminary examination conducted after a significant price fall in IEX shares following a CERC announcement on July 23, 2025. An Investigating Authority was appointed on September 12, 2025, and search & seizure operations were conducted pursuant to an order from the Hon'ble Special Court.

- Trigger: Significant price fall in IEX scrip after CERC announcement on July 23, 2025 (after-market hours)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - The order involves insider trading allegations in IEX, a significant listed entity. The significant price fall following the CERC announcement and subsequent enforcement action may affect investor confidence in the scrip and highlight risks of information leakage ahead of regulatory announcements.

**Regulatory Impact:** High - This enforcement action demonstrates SEBI's proactive approach to market surveillance and willingness to take swift interim action, including search and seizure operations, in suspected insider trading cases. The ex-parte nature of the order indicates urgency and seriousness of the alleged violations.

**Operational Impact:** High for named entities - The 8 Noticees face interim restrictions pending investigation completion. For broader market participants, this reinforces the need for strict compliance with insider trading regulations, particularly around handling of UPSI related to regulatory announcements.

**Investor Impact:** The order serves as a warning about illegal trading practices and SEBI's enforcement capabilities. Investors should note the regulatory scrutiny on trading patterns around material announcements and ensure their own compliance with applicable regulations.
