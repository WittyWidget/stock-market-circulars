title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework Updates - Securities Movement
  Across ESM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective August 14, 2025, adding one new security (Spice Islands Industries Ltd) and moving Galaxy Cloud Kitchens Ltd to a higher ESM stage. The consolidated list shows 33+ securities currently under various ESM stages with enhanced monitoring and trading restrictions.

## Key Points

- One new security added to ESM framework: Spice Islands Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 526827)
- Galaxy Cloud Kitchens Ltd (Scrip Code: 506186) moved to higher ESM stage
- No securities moved to lower ESM stages or exited the framework
- Consolidated list maintains 33+ securities across ESM Stage I and II
- Framework includes both main board and SME securities

## Regulatory Changes

- Enhanced surveillance measures applied to newly added security
- Stricter monitoring for Galaxy Cloud Kitchens Ltd due to stage elevation
- Continued application of existing ESM framework rules

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ESM framework requirements
- Enhanced due diligence required for transactions in listed securities
- Adherence to specific trading restrictions and monitoring protocols
- Compliance with disclosure and reporting requirements for ESM securities

## Important Dates

- **August 14, 2025**: Effective date for all ESM framework changes
- **August 13, 2025**: Circular issue date

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ESM face enhanced monitoring, potential trading restrictions, and increased compliance requirements. New addition and stage changes may affect liquidity and trading volumes for affected securities.

**Market Impact**: Limited scope with only two securities affected, minimal broader market impact expected. Continued surveillance framework maintains market integrity and investor protection.
