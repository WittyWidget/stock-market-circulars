title: 'Sub-Division of Equity Shares of BLUEGOD ENTERTAINMENT LTD (Scrip Code: 539175)'
---

## Summary

Bluegod Entertainment Ltd (Scrip Code: 539175) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares, splitting each existing share of Rs. 10 face value into 10 shares of Re. 1 face value each. The record date for this corporate action is set for September 2, 2025.

## Key Points

- Sub-division ratio: 1 equity share of Rs. 10 becomes 10 equity shares of Re. 1 each
- Record date: September 2, 2025
- Effective date: September 2, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE924N01016) for Rs. 10 paid-up shares will become invalid from September 2, 2025
- New ISIN for Re. 1 paid-up shares will be communicated separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE924N01016 for Rs. 10 paid-up equity shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after September 2, 2025. A new ISIN will be assigned for the subdivided Re. 1 paid-up shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the change in share structure and ISIN
- All transactions after September 2, 2025 must use the new ISIN (to be announced)

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: September 2, 2025
- **Effective Date**: September 2, 2025
- **ISIN Validity**: Current ISIN invalid from September 2, 2025 onwards

## Impact Assessment

This sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares tenfold while reducing the face value proportionally. Shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. The action may improve liquidity and make shares more affordable for retail investors, though the total value of holdings remains unchanged.
