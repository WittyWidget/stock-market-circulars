## Key Points

- Company affected: CHIRAHARIT LIMITED - SME IPO
- Scrip Code: 544561
- Current trading mode: Trade for Trade segment (MT Group)
- New trading mode: Rolling segment (M Group)
- Effective date: Friday, October 24, 2025
- Notice reference: Continuation of Exchange Notice No. 20251007-48 dated October 7, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for CHIRAHARIT LIMITED equity shares will change from:
- **From**: Trade for Trade segment (MT Group) - where each trade requires individual settlement
- **To**: Rolling segment (M Group) - allowing continuous trading with regular settlement cycles

This represents a progression in the stock's trading status, typically indicating improved compliance or reduced surveillance concerns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members should note the group change in their systems
- All trades after October 24, 2025 will follow Rolling segment rules
- No specific action required from investors
- Trading members may contact Mr. Anurag Jain (Tel: 022-2272 8822) for further details

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 9, 2025
- **Previous Notice**: October 7, 2025 (Notice No. 20251007-48)
- **Effective Date**: October 24, 2025 (Friday)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The shift from Trade for Trade to Rolling segment is positive for the stock's liquidity. It allows for intraday trading and regular settlement cycles instead of individual trade settlements, which should:
- Increase trading volumes
- Improve price discovery
- Reduce transaction costs
- Enhance market participation

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the group change. The company's move to M Group indicates it has met BSE's requirements for graduation from the more restrictive T2T segment.

**Investor Impact**: Medium - existing shareholders will benefit from improved liquidity and easier entry/exit opportunities.
