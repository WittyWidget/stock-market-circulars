  - Purchase of REs only grants right to participate in ongoing Rights Issue with requisite application money

## Important Dates

- **Issue Closing Date**: November 14, 2025 (after which unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to shareholders and potential investors of MAGNUS STEELAND INFRA LIMITED. The six-day window between REs trading closure (November 10) and issue closure (November 14) allows final subscription decisions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure proper client communication, correct ISIN usage (INE898E20011), and appropriate disclaimers in contract notes. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires adequate operational preparedness.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders can trade their rights entitlements or subscribe to the rights issue. Investors purchasing REs must understand they acquire participation rights, not equity shares, and must act before November 14, 2025 to avoid lapsing.
