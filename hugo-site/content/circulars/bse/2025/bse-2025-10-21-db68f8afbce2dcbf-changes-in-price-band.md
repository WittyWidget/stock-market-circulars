## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The price band revisions will restrict intraday price movements for the affected 15 scrips, potentially reducing trading volumes and liquidity in these securities. The tighter bands (5% and 10%) indicate heightened surveillance concerns.

**Trading Impact:** Trading activity in these scrips will be constrained within the specified price bands, which may affect short-term trading strategies and volatility-based positions.

**Investor Protection:** The measure aims to protect investors from excessive price volatility and potential manipulation in these securities, which are likely under surveillance due to unusual price movements or other concerns.
