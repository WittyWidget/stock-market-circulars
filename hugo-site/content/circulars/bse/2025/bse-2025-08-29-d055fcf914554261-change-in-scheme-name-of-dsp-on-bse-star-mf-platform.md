title: Change in Scheme Name of DSP Mutual Fund Schemes on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

DSP Mutual Fund has announced changes to scheme names and benchmarks for multiple Fund of Fund (FoF) schemes effective August 31, 2025. These changes are pursuant to SEBI's Standardized Framework for Fund of Fund Schemes communicated on June 30, 2025.

## Key Points

- Seven DSP Fund of Fund schemes will have revised names incorporating "Overseas Equity Omni FoF" or "Specific Debt/Equity" terminology
- DSP Income Plus Arbitrage Fund of Fund will have its benchmark changed from CRISIL Dynamic Bond A-III Index to NIFTY Composite Debt Index
- Changes will be effective from August 31, 2025
- All other provisions of the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

SEBI has issued a Standardized Framework for Fund of Fund Schemes requiring standardized naming conventions for FoF schemes, leading to these mandatory name changes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Unit holders are advised to update their PAN, KYC, email address, mobile number, and nominee details with the AMC
- Unit holders should link their PAN with Aadhaar Number
- Investors can check for unclaimed redemptions and IDCW payments on the Fund's website

## Important Dates

- **August 31, 2025**: Effective date for all scheme name and benchmark changes
- **August 22, 2025**: Date of circular issuance by DSP Asset Managers

## Impact Assessment

The changes are administrative in nature and will not affect the investment strategy or portfolio of the schemes. Existing investors will automatically have their investments transferred to the renamed schemes without any action required. The benchmark change for DSP Income Plus Arbitrage Fund may slightly affect performance measurement but not the underlying investment approach.
