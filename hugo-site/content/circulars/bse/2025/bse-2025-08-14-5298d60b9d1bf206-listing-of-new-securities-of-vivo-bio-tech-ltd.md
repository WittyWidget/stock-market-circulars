## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is a standard equity listing process. The lock-in period until February 28, 2026 ensures shares cannot be traded immediately, providing market stability. The preferential allotment to non-promoters may slightly dilute promoter holding but strengthens the company's equity base.
