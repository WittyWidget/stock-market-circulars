## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. Standard rights entitlements trading procedures apply as per existing BSE guidelines.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform clients about RE trading commencement
- Contract notes must include prominent disclaimer about RE purchases
- Disclaimer must clarify that REs only provide right to participate in rights issue or renounce before closure
- Trading members must reference notices 20200305-21 and 20200518-34 for additional details

## Important Dates

- **July 31, 2025**: Rights Issue opens and RE trading begins

Medium impact on Mahindra Logistics shareholders who can trade their rights entitlements during the specified period. Trading members need to ensure proper client communication and compliance with disclaimer requirements. Limited broader market impact as this is company-specific corporate action.
