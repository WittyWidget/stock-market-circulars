title: Surveillance Measure for Securities Under IBC - August 2025 Update
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updated surveillance measures for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework effective August 5, 2025. The key change is the exclusion of Omkar Speciality Chemicals Ltd (Scrip Code: 533317) from the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) for companies under IBC.

## Key Points

- No new securities added to Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure)
- No securities moved between IBC surveillance stages
- Omkar Speciality Chemicals Ltd excluded from ASM framework
- Consolidated list maintains 14+ companies under various IBC surveillance stages
- Framework includes companies like Arshiya Limited, Ansal Properties, and others

## Regulatory Changes

The circular removes one company from the Additional Surveillance Measure framework while maintaining the existing multi-stage surveillance structure for companies under insolvency proceedings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies under IBC surveillance must continue compliance with applicable stage requirements
- Market participants should note the exclusion of Omkar Speciality Chemicals from ASM
- Trading members must adhere to surveillance conditions for listed securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 5, 2025
- All changes to surveillance measures take effect from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as only one company is being excluded from surveillance measures. The exclusion of Omkar Speciality Chemicals Ltd from ASM may normalize its trading conditions. Overall surveillance framework for IBC companies remains intact with continued monitoring of companies in various stages of insolvency proceedings.
