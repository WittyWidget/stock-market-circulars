title: Submission of Half Yearly Internal Audit Report by Clearing Members
---

## Summary

BSE has issued requirements for clearing members to submit half-yearly internal audit reports. The audit must verify compliance with margin collection requirements, proper segregation of client funds and securities, prohibition on cash dealings, and adherence to lending/borrowing regulations. The circular provides a detailed checklist format covering key areas of verification including margins, dealing with client funds and securities, and various regulatory compliance aspects.

## Key Points

- Clearing members must conduct and submit half-yearly internal audit reports
- Audit must cover margin collection on Consolidated Crystallized Obligation from Trading Members (TMs) and Custodial Participants (CPs)
- Margins must be collected only in cash form for F&O and Currency segments (except physical settlement components)
- Verification of EOD margins and peak margins collection in prescribed forms
- Audit must confirm margin collection reported to Clearing Corporation matches actual collection
- Client funds and securities must be segregated from proprietary accounts
- Cash dealings with TM/CP are prohibited
- Members cannot pledge client securities to banks/NBFCs for raising funds
- Daily Margin Statements (DMS) must be issued to clients with proof of delivery maintained

## Regulatory Changes

The circular reinforces existing regulatory requirements and provides a standardized audit format. Key regulatory references include:

- Circular 20200710-45 regarding cash-only margin collection for F&O and Currency segments
- Rule 8(1)(f) & 8(3)(f) of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 prohibiting fund-based activities
- Circulars 20220107-45 (January 7, 2022) and 20220922-49 (September 22, 2022) regarding money received terms
- Requirements for client fund segregation and prohibition on unauthorized activities

## Compliance Requirements

**For Clearing Members:**
- Conduct half-yearly internal audit covering specified areas

- Ensure proper segregation of client and proprietary accounts
- Maintain records of monies borrowed or loaned
- Issue statement of accounts to trading members/custodial participants
- Issue Daily Margin Statements (DMS) to clients with required details
- Maintain proof of delivery/dispatch logs for DMS

**Audit Verification Areas:**

- Adequacy of EOD and peak margins collected
- Accuracy of margin reporting to Clearing Corporation
- Segregation of client funds, securities, and commodities
- Absence of cash dealings with TM/CP

## Important Dates
