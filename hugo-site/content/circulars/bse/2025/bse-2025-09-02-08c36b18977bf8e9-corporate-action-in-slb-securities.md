## Summary

BSE has announced corporate actions for 23 companies involved in Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) transactions. All listed corporate actions are dividend declarations with specified book closure dates, ex-dates, and shut periods during which SLB transactions will be suspended for these securities.

## Key Points

- 23 companies have announced dividend declarations with ex-dates ranging from September 4-23, 2025
- SLB transactions will be suspended during shut periods (typically 1-3 days including the ex-date)
- All corporate actions listed are dividend distributions
- Book closure dates and ex-dates are the same for most securities

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine disclosure of corporate actions affecting SLB securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must cease SLB transactions during the specified shut periods for each security
- Lenders and borrowers must reconcile positions before shut period commencement
- Securities cannot be lent or borrowed during the shut period dates specified for each company

## Important Dates

- **Earliest Ex-Date**: September 4, 2025 (Supriya Lifescience Limited)
- **Latest Ex-Date**: September 23, 2025 (Mold-Tek Packaging Limited)
- **Shut Periods**: Range from 1-3 days encompassing the ex-dividend dates
- **Key September 12, 2025**: Multiple companies (7) have ex-dates on this date
- **Key September 19, 2025**: Multiple companies (8) have ex-dates on this date

## Impact Assessment

Moderate operational impact on SLB market participants who must temporarily suspend lending/borrowing activities for affected securities during shut periods. The staggered dates allow for portfolio adjustments. Impact is routine and predictable, allowing market participants to plan positions accordingly. No systemic market impact expected as these are standard dividend distributions with typical shut period protocols.
