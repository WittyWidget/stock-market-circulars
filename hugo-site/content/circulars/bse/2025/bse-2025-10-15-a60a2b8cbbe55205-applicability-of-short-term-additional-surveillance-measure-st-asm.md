## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM Framework is a surveillance measure designed to alert investors about securities showing abnormal price movements or volatility. Securities under ST-ASM are subject to:
- Enhanced surveillance monitoring
- Potential trading restrictions
- Additional disclosure requirements
- Staged progression based on continued unusual activity

Securities may transition between different surveillance frameworks (ST-ASM, LT-ASM, ESM, GSM, Trade for Trade, Pledge Framework) based on ongoing monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the enhanced surveillance status of listed securities
- Trading members should inform clients about securities under ST-ASM
- Investors should exercise additional caution when trading these securities
- Securities may be subject to specific trading restrictions based on ASM stage

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 16, 2025
- All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Affects trading liquidity and investor confidence in 20+ securities

**Operational Impact**: Securities under ST-ASM face enhanced scrutiny and potential trading restrictions, which may result in:
- Reduced trading volumes
- Wider bid-ask spreads
- Lower liquidity
- Increased margin requirements
- Potential difficulty in position exits

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should be aware of enhanced surveillance status and associated risks. Some securities transitioning to stricter frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM) face more severe trading restrictions.

**Note**: Securities marked with special symbols indicate specific categories:
- @ = SME Scrips
- * = Also listed on NSE or moving to LT-ASM
- $ = Moving to ESM Framework
- ~ = T+0 Scrips
