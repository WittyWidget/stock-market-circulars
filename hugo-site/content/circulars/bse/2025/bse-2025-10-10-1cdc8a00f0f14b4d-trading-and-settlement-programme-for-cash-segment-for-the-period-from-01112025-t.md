## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** This circular is essential for operational planning by trading members, custodians, and clearing members. It provides clarity on settlement cycles, enabling proper resource allocation and fund management throughout November 2025.

**Market Impact:** Minimal direct market impact as this is a routine monthly schedule. However, awareness of non-trading days and settlement timelines is crucial for liquidity management and cash flow planning by market participants.

**Member Requirements:** Trading members must ensure their back-office systems are updated with the settlement schedule, adequate staffing for daily deadlines, and coordination with custodians for timely confirmations. Failure to meet deadlines can result in auction penalties and settlement failures.

**Risk Management:** The schedule ensures systematic risk management through defined auction settlement dates (T+2 from regular settlement), allowing the exchange to address delivery shortfalls through auction mechanisms. The staggered settlement numbers aid in tracking and reconciliation processes.
