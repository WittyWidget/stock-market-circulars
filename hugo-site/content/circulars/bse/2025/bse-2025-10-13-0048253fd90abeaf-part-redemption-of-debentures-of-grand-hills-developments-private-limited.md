## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a private limited company with privately placed debentures, so market impact is minimal and limited to existing debenture holders.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the reduced face value, but this is a routine operational adjustment.

**Investor Impact**: Medium for debenture holders - They will receive part redemption proceeds and interest payment. The reduced face value reflects the partial return of principal, which is positive for liquidity but reduces the investment size.
