- Revision applies to both scrip codes: 974290 and 974800

- BSE will issue separate notices for the revised record date
- Scrip code 974290: Interest payment and partial redemption
- Scrip code 974800: Interest payment and full redemption

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes - this is a procedural revision of corporate action timing by the issuing company.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the revised record date
- Debenture holders must hold securities on August 11, 2025 to be eligible for interest and redemption payments
- Previous notices dated August 1, 2025 (Notice No. 20250801-15 and 20250801-13) are superseded

## Important Dates

- **Original Record Date**: August 5, 2025 (cancelled)
- **Revised Record Date**: August 11, 2025
- **Notice Date**: August 4, 2025
- **Previous Notices**: August 1, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Moderate impact on debenture holders who need to adjust their trading strategies. The six-day postponement provides additional time for investors to position themselves for eligibility. No impact on the underlying corporate action amounts or terms, only timing.
