---

## Summary

BSE has approved the listing of 8 million new equity shares of Adishakti Loha and Ispat Limited (Scrip Code: 543377) effective August 14, 2025. These shares were issued through preferential allotment to promoters and non-promoters following warrant conversion at Rs. 12.80 per share.

## Key Points

- 8 million equity shares of Rs. 10 face value issued at Rs. 2.80 premium
- Shares issued through preferential basis pursuant to warrant conversion
- Distribution numbers: 4558001 to 12558000
- Allotment date: May 16, 2025
- Issue price: Rs. 12.80 per share
- ISIN: INE0CWK01019
- Shares rank pari-passu with existing equity shares

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. Standard listing procedure for preferential allotment shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members informed of new securities available for trading
- Lock-in restrictions apply as specified
- Standard compliance with listing regulations

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: May 16, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: August 14, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry (6M shares)**: February 19, 2026
- **Lock-in Expiry (2M shares)**: February 19, 2027

## Impact Assessment

Moderate impact on existing shareholders due to 8 million share dilution. Lock-in provisions (2 million shares until 2027, 6 million until 2026) will restrict immediate trading volume. Preferential allotment strengthens promoter holding and provides capital for business expansion.
