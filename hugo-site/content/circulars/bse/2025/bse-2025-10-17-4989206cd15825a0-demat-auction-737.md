**Operational Impact**: Medium - affects brokers with failed delivery obligations for the listed securities. The auction mechanism ensures settlement completion and maintains market integrity.

**Market Impact**: Limited to specific securities and quantities. Large quantities in scrips like WELCURE DRUGS (74,441 shares) may experience price volatility during auction settlement.

**Broker Impact**: Direct impact on members with delivery shortfalls who must purchase securities through auction, potentially at unfavorable prices with applicable penalties.
