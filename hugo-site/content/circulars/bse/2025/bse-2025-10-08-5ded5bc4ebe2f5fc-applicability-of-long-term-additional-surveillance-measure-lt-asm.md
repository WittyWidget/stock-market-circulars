title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective October 09, 2025. The circular identifies securities newly shortlisted for LT-ASM, securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages, securities moving directly to Stage IV, and securities exiting the LT-ASM framework due to inclusion in other surveillance frameworks (ESM, Trade for Trade).

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted in Long Term ASM Framework: Bharat Seats Ltd, Earthstahl & Alloys Ltd, GTT Data Solutions Ltd, and Sujala Trading & Holdings Ltd
- 3 securities moved to higher ASM stages: Ambo Agritec Ltd (Stage III), Mcleod Russel India Ltd (Stage II), Sunrakshakk Industries India Ltd (Stage II)
- 3 securities moved directly to Stage IV: Indo Thai Securities Ltd, KIOCL Ltd (including T+0 scrip)
- 2 securities moving out of LT-ASM framework: Hiliks Technologies Ltd and Sahara Housingfina Corporation Ltd (both moved to ESM Framework)
- Consolidated list includes over 8 securities in various ASM stages

## Regulatory Changes

The Long Term ASM framework applies enhanced surveillance measures to securities based on various risk parameters. Securities in this framework are subject to:
- Price bands and trading restrictions based on ASM stage
- Higher margin requirements
- Periodic review for stage progression or exit
- Stage IV represents the highest level of surveillance under LT-ASM

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the changed surveillance status of affected securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for client trades in LT-ASM securities
- Margin requirements and price bands specific to each ASM stage must be applied
- Systems must be updated to reflect new ASM classifications effective October 09, 2025

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 09, 2025 - All LT-ASM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Securities under LT-ASM face restricted trading conditions including price bands, additional margins, and reduced liquidity. Movement to higher stages (especially Stage IV) significantly restricts trading activity.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading in affected securities will experience:
- Limited price movement (strict price bands)
- Higher margin requirements
- Potential reduction in liquidity
- Increased scrutiny on transactions

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update surveillance parameters, margin calculations, and risk management systems for all affected securities. Securities moving to ESM or other frameworks require additional operational adjustments.
