The entire promoter shareholding and all securities in promoter demat accounts will be frozen during suspension.

- Notice issued pursuant to SEBI Master Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

### For Affected Companies
- Must comply with all provisions of Regulation 76 of SEBI (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 2018 to satisfaction of BSE
- Compliance deadline: November 17, 2025 to avoid suspension
- Post-suspension: Must follow prescribed revocation procedure and meet all extant norms for lifting suspension

### For Market Participants

- Understand post-suspension trading restrictions (trade-for-trade, Z group, weekly basis)

## Important Dates

- **October 20, 2025**: Notice issued

- **November 20, 2025**: Trading suspension becomes effective (if non-compliance continues)
- **15 days after suspension**: Trade-for-trade basis trading begins on first trading day of each week for six months

## Impact Assessment

### Market Impact
- Investors in affected securities face liquidity constraints starting November 20, 2025
- Promoters completely restricted from trading their holdings during suspension
- Post-suspension, severely limited trading opportunities (once per week, trade-for-trade only)

### Affected Companies
1. **Ramasigns Industries Ltd** (Scrip: 515127)
2. **Retro Green Revolution Ltd** (Scrip: 519191)
3. **Vasudhagama Enterprises Ltd** (Scrip: 539291)

### Operational Impact
- Complete trading halt unless last-minute compliance achieved
- Promoter shareholding and demat accounts frozen, preventing any corporate actions or transactions
- Migration to Z group with restrictive trading mechanisms post-suspension
- Revocation requires compliance plus additional procedural formalities

### Investor Considerations
- Current shareholders should monitor compliance status before November 17, 2025
- High risk of illiquidity if suspension proceeds
- Limited exit opportunities post-suspension (weekly trade-for-trade only)
- Uncertain timeline for revocation depending on company remediation efforts
