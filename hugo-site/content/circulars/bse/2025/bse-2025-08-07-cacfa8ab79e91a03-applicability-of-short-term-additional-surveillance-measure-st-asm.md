title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective August 8, 2025. Five securities are being added to ST-ASM Stage I, including Franklin Industries Ltd, Incon Engineers Ltd, MFS Intercorp Ltd, and Sarda Energy & Minerals Ltd (both regular and T+0 scrips). Two securities are moving out of the ST-ASM framework - Benara Bearings and Pistons Ltd and Sainik Finance & Industries Ltd.

## Key Points

- 5 securities newly shortlisted in ST-ASM Stage I framework
- 2 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages
- Framework includes both regular and T+0 scrips
- Consolidated list shows 18+ securities currently under ST-ASM surveillance

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM framework updates
- Securities subject to enhanced surveillance measures and trading restrictions
- Special marking system for SME scrips (@) and T+0 scrips (~)

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must adhere to ST-ASM trading conditions for listed securities
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting requirements for affected scrips
- Compliance with surveillance framework parameters

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 8, 2025
- All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable from this date

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ST-ASM face additional surveillance measures including potential price monitoring, volume restrictions, and enhanced disclosure requirements. The addition of new securities to Stage I surveillance indicates heightened regulatory attention to these stocks' trading patterns. Sainik Finance's exit from ST-ASM due to inclusion in ESM Framework suggests escalated surveillance measures.
