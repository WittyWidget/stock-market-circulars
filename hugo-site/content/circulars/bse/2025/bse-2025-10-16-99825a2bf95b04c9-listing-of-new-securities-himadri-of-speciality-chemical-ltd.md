- **Number of Shares**: 308,000 equity shares of Re. 1/- each
- **Issue Price**: Rs. 316/- per share (Face Value: Re. 1/- + Premium: Rs. 315/-)
- **Allotment Date**: August 13, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: October 17, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard new listing notification following preferential allotment.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the new securities are available for trading from October 17, 2025
- Lock-in restrictions apply to all allotted shares as per specified schedule
- Shares must be traded using the existing ISIN: INE019C01026

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: August 13, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: October 17, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry Dates**:
  - 13,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 493849500-493862499): April 29, 2026
  - 295,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 493862500-494157499): April 30, 2026

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing of 308,000 shares represents a relatively small preferential allotment. The complete lock-in period extending until April 2026 means these shares cannot be sold immediately, limiting near-term supply pressure.

**Dilution Impact**: Minimal dilution to existing shareholders given the small issue size.

**Liquidity Impact**: No immediate impact on trading liquidity as all shares are under lock-in until April 2026. Post lock-in expiry, the addition of 308,000 shares may provide marginal increase in floating stock.

**Investor Consideration**: The warrant conversion at Rs. 316/- per share indicates investor confidence at that price point as of the allotment date in August 2025.
