## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - The auction involves relatively small quantities for most scrips compared to their typical trading volumes. Even the largest quantity (102,000 shares of Alstone Text) represents a routine settlement process.

**Operational Impact:** Low - Standard demat auction process affecting specific members with delivery shortages. This is a regular market mechanism to ensure settlement integrity.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal - The auction addresses delivery failures and ensures buyers receive their securities. The quantities involved are not significant enough to cause market disruption.

**Scope:** The auction covers a diverse range of companies from large caps (State Bank, Wipro, Adani group companies) to small and mid-caps, indicating scattered delivery failures across the market rather than concentrated issues in specific sectors.
