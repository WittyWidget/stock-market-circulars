## Impact Assessment

This part redemption will reduce the outstanding principal amount of the debentures, affecting the investment value for holders. The reduced face value from the original amount to Rs. 12,500 indicates a significant partial repayment. Debenture holders on record date will receive both the redemption proceeds and accrued interest. Trading liquidity may be temporarily affected as market participants adjust to the new face value.
