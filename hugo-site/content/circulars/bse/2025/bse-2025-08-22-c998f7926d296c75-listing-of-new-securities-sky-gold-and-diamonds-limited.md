## Impact Assessment

Moderate impact limited to Sky Gold And Diamonds Limited stakeholders. The substantial increase in share count (approximately 20.7 lakh shares) may affect trading volumes and liquidity. Lock-in period until February 2027 restricts immediate trading of these securities, providing stability but limiting short-term liquidity impact.
