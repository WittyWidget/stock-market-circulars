## Key Points

- Provident Cedar Private Limited (PCPL-17-4-28-PVT, INE0NF907031) debentures reduced to Rs. 355,865.36 per debenture
- Provident Meryta Private Limited (PMPL-ZC-30-10-29-PVT, INE0NF807025) debentures reduced to Rs. 5,000 per debenture
- Changes effective from July 30, 2025
- Trading members must note the new face values for trading purposes

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new reduced face values
- All trading in these debentures must reflect the revised face values from the effective date
- Trading members are required to take note of these changes

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 30, 2025
- **Notice Date**: July 29, 2025
- **DR Reference**: DR-684/2025-2026

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this affects only two specific private company debentures. The partial redemption is a routine corporate action that reduces the outstanding principal amount of the debt securities. Trading members need to ensure their systems reflect the correct face values to avoid settlement issues.
