## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - Routine preferential allotment listing with approximately 6 million shares added to existing float. Lock-in period prevents immediate trading impact.

**Dilution Impact**: Moderate dilution for existing shareholders depending on pre-issue share capital, but shares issued to non-promoters may improve public float over time after lock-in expiry.
