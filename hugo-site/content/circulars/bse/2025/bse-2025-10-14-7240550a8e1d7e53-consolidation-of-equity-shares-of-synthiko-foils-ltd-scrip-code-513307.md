## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Shareholders**: Existing shareholders will see their shareholding adjusted in a 2:1 ratio. Shareholders holding two shares of Rs.5/- face value will receive one share of Rs.10/- face value. The proportionate ownership and value remain unchanged.

**Trading Impact**: Trading in the scrip will be suspended from the record date. The suspension allows for updating records and systems to reflect the new share structure.

**Liquidity Impact**: Temporary impact on liquidity due to trading suspension. Post-consolidation, the reduced number of shares may affect liquidity dynamics depending on shareholding pattern.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and depositories need to update their systems to reflect the new ISIN and share denomination. Clients' demat accounts will be adjusted automatically to reflect the consolidated holdings.
