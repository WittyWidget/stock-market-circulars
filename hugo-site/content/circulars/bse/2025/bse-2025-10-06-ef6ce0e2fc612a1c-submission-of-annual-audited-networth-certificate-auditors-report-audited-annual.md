## Impact Assessment

**High Impact on Clearing Members:**

This circular has significant implications for all clearing members across BSE's trading and clearing segments:

1. **Operational Impact:** Non-compliance may result in disablement of clearing membership, severely impacting business operations

2. **Financial Impact:** 
   - Daily penalties ranging from Rs. 100 to Rs. 300 can accumulate quickly
   - Networth shortfalls trigger immediate blocking of deposits (10% to 90% depending on shortfall severity)
   - Blocked deposits affect operational liquidity and trading capacity

3. **Regulatory Risk:** Failure to maintain minimum networth requirements may lead to suspension or termination of clearing privileges

4. **Capital Requirements:** Members must ensure adequate capital is maintained to meet segment-specific networth thresholds throughout the year

5. **Banks Face Higher Bar:** Currency derivative segment requires Rs. 500 crores networth for banks, significantly higher than the standard Rs. 5-50 crores for non-bank members

6. **Administrative Burden:** Members must coordinate with auditors to ensure timely completion and submission of comprehensive financial documentation

Clearing members should prioritize compliance to avoid operational disruptions and financial penalties.
