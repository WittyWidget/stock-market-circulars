## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** October 8, 2025
- **Effective Date:** November 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects trading in 31 SME securities with lot size reductions ranging from 50-75% (most at 50%). Smaller lot sizes generally improve liquidity and accessibility for retail investors.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members need to update systems and processes to accommodate new lot sizes. One month transition period provided for implementation.
