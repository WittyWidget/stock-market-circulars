## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects shareholders of 3I INFOTECH LIMITED who wish to participate in or renounce their rights entitlements during the specified trading window.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure proper client communication and include required disclaimers in contract notes. The trade-for-trade settlement mechanism and dematerialized-only requirement necessitate specific operational handling.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders have a 14-day window (October 07-20, 2025) to renounce their rights entitlements if they choose not to subscribe. Failure to act before the issue closing date (October 27, 2025) will result in lapse and extinguishment of REs.
