## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with enhanced margin requirements for securities in ESM framework
- All trades in ESM securities subject to 100% upfront margin collection
- No intraday trading permitted (trade-for-trade settlement)
- Brokers must ensure clients are aware of ESM status before executing trades
- Position limits as per ESM stage requirements must be adhered to

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 20, 2025
- All ESM framework changes take effect from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities newly added or moved to higher ESM stages will face significantly restricted liquidity due to 100% margin requirements and trade-for-trade settlement. This typically results in reduced trading volumes and wider bid-ask spreads.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding securities in higher ESM stages face increased capital requirements for any additional purchases and cannot engage in intraday trading. Securities moving to lower stages or exiting ESM will see improved liquidity and reduced trading costs.

**Market Impact**: The ESM framework serves as an early warning system for securities with abnormal price/volume behavior. Inclusion often indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny and potential corporate governance or financial concerns. Removal from ESM generally signals normalization of trading patterns.

**Risk Consideration**: Investors should exercise caution with ESM securities as they are identified based on unusual market activity, sharp price movements, or other surveillance concerns that warrant enhanced monitoring.
