title: Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Framework Updates
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework with 8 securities being added and 7 securities being removed, effective August 18, 2025. The framework applies heightened monitoring and trading restrictions to securities exhibiting unusual price movements or trading patterns.

## Key Points

- 8 securities added to ST-ASM framework including Asian Hotels (North) Ltd, CL Educate Ltd, and KRBL Ltd
- 7 securities removed from ST-ASM framework including First Fintec Ltd, Inter Globe Finance Ltd, and NDL Ventures Ltd
- No securities moved between different ASM stages
- Framework includes securities from main board, SME, and T+0 segments
- Several securities moved out due to inclusion in other surveillance frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM)

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to apply 5/15/30 days additional surveillance measures to identified securities. Securities under this framework face enhanced monitoring, margin requirements, and potential trading restrictions based on their surveillance stage.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with enhanced margin requirements for ST-ASM securities
- Position limits and delivery obligations may apply to affected securities
- Market participants should review their portfolios for exposure to newly added securities
- Brokers must inform clients about additional surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **August 18, 2025**: Effective date for all ST-ASM framework changes
- All additions and removals become applicable from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

The surveillance measures typically result in reduced trading volumes and increased volatility for affected securities. Investors may face higher margin requirements and delivery obligations. The removal of 7 securities provides relief to those stocks, while addition of 8 new securities indicates continued market monitoring concerns. SME securities marked with @ symbol face additional scrutiny due to their smaller market capitalization and higher volatility potential.
