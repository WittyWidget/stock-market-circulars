## Impact Assessment

This circular has minimal market impact as it pertains to routine debt market operations for institutional and retail debt investors. The non-competitive bidding facility provides retail investors access to SDL auctions. The auction size of Rs. 9,410 crore is spread across multiple state securities, representing standard state government borrowing programs. Impact is limited to debt market participants interested in state government securities with varying maturities from 2033 to 2042.
