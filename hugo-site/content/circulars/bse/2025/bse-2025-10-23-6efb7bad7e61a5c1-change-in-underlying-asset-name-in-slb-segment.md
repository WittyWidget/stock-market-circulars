## Summary

BSE has notified trading members about a change in the underlying asset name for Tata Motors Limited (scrip code 500570) in the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) segment. The underlying scrip name will change from "TATA MOTORS" to "TATA MOTORS PASSENGER VEHICLES LIMITED" with corresponding product code change from "TATAMOTORS" to "TMPV", effective October 24, 2025.

## Key Points

- Scrip Code: 500570 (Tata Motors Ltd in Equity Segment)
- Old Underlying Scrip Name: TATA MOTORS
- Old Product Code: TATAMOTORS
- New Underlying Scrip Name: TATA MOTORS PASSENGER VEHICLES LIMITED
- New Product Code: TMPV
- Changes will be reflected in SLB_CMDDMMYY file
- No changes to any other parameters in the files

## Regulatory Changes

This is an administrative update to align the underlying asset naming in the SLB segment master files. The change reflects the corporate restructuring or naming convention update for Tata Motors' passenger vehicle business. No regulatory framework changes are involved.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the name and product code changes in their systems
- Update internal references to reflect new underlying scrip name and product code
- Review end of day contract master file (SLB_CMDDMMYY) dated October 23, 2025 for the changes
- Ensure systems accommodate the new naming convention for SLB transactions

## Important Dates

- **October 23, 2025**: Changes included in end of day contract master file
- **October 24, 2025**: Effective date for change in underlying asset name and product code

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a nomenclature change with no impact on trading operations, settlement processes, or any other trading parameters.

**Operational Impact**: Low. Trading members need to update their internal systems and references to reflect the new underlying asset name and product code. The change is limited to the SLB segment master file naming convention.

**System Impact**: Trading members' systems that reference the product code or underlying scrip name in SLB transactions will need to be updated to recognize both the old and new nomenclature during any transition period.
