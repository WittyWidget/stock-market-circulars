## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The ISIN change affects all trading members and shareholders of Rolex Rings Ltd. While this is a routine corporate action, it requires system updates across trading platforms and custodial systems.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure their systems are configured with the new ISIN before the ex-date to avoid trade failures or settlement issues. Shareholders will receive shares with the new face value and ISIN after the sub-division becomes effective.
