title: Update Regarding Debt Securities of Aye Finance Ltd - Financial Covenant Modification
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update regarding modifications to financial covenants for debt securities of Aye Finance Ltd. The changes affect both the Debenture Trust Deed (Clause 10.3(a)(iv)) and Key Information Document (Section 6.2.2(a)(iv)), specifically revising the PAR>90 and write-offs ratio requirements.

## Key Points

- Financial covenant ratio (PAR>90 + write-offs to Gross Loan Portfolio) has been revised from a uniform 8% limit
- New tiered structure implemented with relaxed limits
- Changes apply to both Debenture Trust Deed and Key Information Document
- Modification reflects adjusted risk parameters for the company's lending portfolio

## Regulatory Changes

**Previous Provision:**
- Company required to maintain ratio of A:B not more than 8%
- A = aggregate of PAR>90 and write-offs for trailing 12 months
- B = Gross Loan Portfolio

**Revised Provision (Two-Tier Structure):**
1. **Until March 31, 2026:** Maximum ratio of 12% (fifty percent increase from original limit)
2. **From April 1, 2026 until Final Settlement Date:** Maximum ratio of 10% (25% increase from original limit)

Formula remains: (PAR>90 + Write-offs for trailing 12 months) / Gross Loan Portfolio Ã— 100

## Compliance Requirements

- Aye Finance Ltd must maintain the revised PAR>90 and write-offs ratios as per the new tiered structure
- Debenture trustees must monitor compliance with modified financial covenants
- Debenture holders should note the relaxed covenant requirements
- Company must ensure Gross Loan Portfolio calculations align with covenant definitions

## Important Dates

- **March 31, 2026:** End of first tier with 12% maximum ratio
- **April 1, 2026:** Commencement of second tier with 10% maximum ratio
- **Final Settlement Date:** End date for modified covenant applicability (as per debenture terms)

## Impact Assessment

**For Aye Finance Ltd:**
- Provides increased operational flexibility in managing loan portfolio
- Allows higher tolerance for non-performing assets and write-offs in near term
- May indicate anticipated stress in asset quality requiring covenant relief

**For Debenture Holders:**
- Increased credit risk due to relaxed asset quality requirements
- Higher permissible levels of PAR>90 may impact recovery expectations
- Should monitor company's actual performance against new thresholds

**Market Implications:**
- Covenant modifications typically signal borrower request due to performance pressures
- Tiered approach suggests expectation of improvement after initial period
- Investors should assess whether relaxed covenants adequately protect their interests
