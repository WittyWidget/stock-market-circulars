title: Addition of Aditya Birla Sun Life Sampoorna Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)
  facility on BSE StAR MF platform
---

## Summary

BSE has added Sampoorna Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) facility for Aditya Birla Sun Life schemes on the BSE StAR MF platform. This facility is available only in Non-Demat mode for specific schemes designated by the AMC and requires manual registration with mandatory target scheme and target amount fields.

## Key Points

- Sampoorna SIP registrations available only for certain Aditya Birla Sun Life schemes in Non-Demat mode
- Manual entry required with dropdown selection between Regular or Sampoorna Systematic Registrations
- Target Scheme and Target Amount are mandatory fields for Sampoorna registrations
- Available for SIP/XSIP/ISIP registration types
- Registration reports available with 'Sampoorna' identifier in Exchange Remarks column

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes - this is an operational enhancement to the existing BSE StAR MF platform to accommodate AMC-specific SIP variants.

## Compliance Requirements

- MFIs/MFDs/RIAs must register Sampoorna SIP through manual entry only
- Must specify Target Scheme and Target Amount for Sampoorna registrations
- Can access registration reports through designated paths in Daily Downloads section
- All other existing procedures and validations remain unchanged

## Important Dates

Effective immediately from August 1, 2025.

## Impact Assessment

Medium operational impact for mutual fund intermediaries who will need to familiarize themselves with the new Sampoorna SIP registration process. This enhances investment options for clients but requires additional fields during registration. No impact on existing Regular SIP processes.
