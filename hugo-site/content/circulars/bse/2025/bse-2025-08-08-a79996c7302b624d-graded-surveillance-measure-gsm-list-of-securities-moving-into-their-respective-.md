## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of three securities into their respective Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) stages. MFS Intercorp Ltd. and Integrated Capital Services Ltd moved to GSM Stage I, while GSL Securities Ltd. moved to GSM Stage III.

## Key Points

- Three securities are being moved to different GSM stages
- Two companies (MFS Intercorp and Integrated Capital Services) are entering GSM Stage I
- One company (GSL Securities) is moving to GSM Stage III
- Securities marked with special symbols may have different movement reasons (ESM or IBC frameworks)

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of graded surveillance measures on the affected securities, which will impose additional trading restrictions and monitoring requirements based on their assigned GSM stage.

## Compliance Requirements

- Enhanced disclosure requirements for the affected companies
- Additional monitoring and reporting obligations
- Compliance with specific trading restrictions applicable to each GSM stage

## Important Dates

Effective date: August 8, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The GSM classification will result in increased trading restrictions and enhanced monitoring for the affected securities. Stage I represents initial surveillance while Stage III indicates more stringent oversight measures. This may impact liquidity and trading volumes for these securities.
