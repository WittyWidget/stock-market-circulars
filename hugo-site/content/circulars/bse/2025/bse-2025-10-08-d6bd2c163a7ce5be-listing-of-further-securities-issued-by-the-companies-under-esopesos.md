## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine listing notification for ESOP/ESOS-issued securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the listing of these securities for trading operations
- Securities are immediately available for trading with no restrictions
- Standard trading and settlement procedures apply

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 8, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date**: Thursday, October 9, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry**: Not applicable (no lock-in period)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. The issuance represents routine ESOP/ESOS conversions with relatively small share quantities compared to the overall market capitalization of the companies involved. ICICI Bank's issuance of 519,475 shares is negligible relative to its total outstanding shares.

**Liquidity Impact**: No significant impact expected on trading liquidity. The absence of lock-in periods means shares are immediately available for trading, but the volumes are small enough not to materially affect market dynamics.

**Shareholder Impact**: Minor dilution across all six companies. Existing shareholders will see marginal increase in outstanding share count due to ESOP/ESOS conversions, which is a standard corporate practice for employee compensation.
