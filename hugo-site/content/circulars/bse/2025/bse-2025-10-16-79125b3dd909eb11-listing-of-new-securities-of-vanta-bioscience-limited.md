## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. This is a routine preferential allotment to promoters representing capital raising activity. The shares are subject to a two-year lock-in period, preventing immediate trading by promoters. The issue size is relatively small and will not significantly affect the company's existing shareholding pattern or market liquidity in the near term.
