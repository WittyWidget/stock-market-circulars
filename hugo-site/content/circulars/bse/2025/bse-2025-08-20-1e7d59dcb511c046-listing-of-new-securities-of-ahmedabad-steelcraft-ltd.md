- Issue price: Rs. 72/- per share (Rs. 10/- face value + Rs. 62/- premium)
- Allotment date: March 27, 2025
- Distribution numbers: 4092001 to 9642000

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Lock-in restrictions apply to different tranches of shares
- Compliance with preferential allotment regulations maintained

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: March 27, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: August 21, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry (40 lakh shares)**: March 31, 2027
- **Lock-in Expiry (15.5 lakh shares)**: March 31, 2026

## Impact Assessment

Significant equity dilution with 55.5 lakh new shares entering the market. The staggered lock-in structure (40 lakh shares locked until March 2027, 15.5 lakh until March 2026) will limit immediate trading liquidity but provides gradual market supply increase. The substantial premium of Rs. 62/- indicates strong investor confidence in the company's prospects.
