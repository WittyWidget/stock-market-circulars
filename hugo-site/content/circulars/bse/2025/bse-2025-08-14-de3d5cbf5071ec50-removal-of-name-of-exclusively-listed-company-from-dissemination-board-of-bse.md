---

## Summary

BSE will remove SKN Industries Limited from its Dissemination Board effective Monday, August 18, 2025, pursuant to SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/DSA/CIR/P/2016/110 dated October 10, 2016. The removal is due to the company exercising its exit option as an Exclusively Listed Company (ELC).

## Key Points

- SKN Industries Limited (CIN: U27320DL1992PLC050472) will be removed from BSE Dissemination Board
- Removal effective from Monday, August 18, 2025
- Company shares will no longer be available on the Exchange's Dissemination Board
- Removal is due to exit option exercise by the exclusively listed company
- Escrow account will remain open for one year as per SEBI regulations

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. Action taken pursuant to existing SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/DSA/CIR/P/2016/110 dated October 10, 2016 regarding exclusively listed companies.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members requiring clarifications on exit option should contact designated personnel
- Company escrow account must remain operational for one year period
- Company contact: Mr. Ravi Kumar (Company Secretary) - 8745800771, info@sknindustries.in
- Exchange contact: Mr. Parag Jain (Manager - Listing Compliance) - 022 2272 8685, Direct.listing@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **August 18, 2025**: Effective date for removal from BSE Dissemination Board
- **One year from removal**: Escrow account closure date

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this affects only one exclusively listed company. Trading members will lose access to SKN Industries shares through BSE's dissemination board, but the company retains its listing status. The exit option provides shareholders with liquidity through the escrow mechanism for one year.
