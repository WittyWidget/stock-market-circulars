- Companies had failed to pay outstanding Annual Listing Fees as required under Regulation 14 of SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular implements existing compliance requirements under SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015, specifically Regulation 14 regarding Annual Listing Fees payment.

## Compliance Requirements

This demonstrates BSE's enforcement of listing fee compliance while providing relief to companies that have rectified their defaults.
