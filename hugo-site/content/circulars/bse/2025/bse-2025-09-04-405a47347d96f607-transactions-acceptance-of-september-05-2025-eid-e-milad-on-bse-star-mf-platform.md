- Orders will appear in Provisional Order Report with September 05 date but Order Status Report will show September 08 date
- Redemption/Switch/STP orders in all scheme categories will be accepted and reported on September 05
- Both redemption unit pay-in and pay-out will be processed same day for September 05 orders

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes - this is operational guidance for holiday procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must follow specified reporting procedures for different fund categories
- Registrars to process orders according to the timeline specified
- NAV applicability rules as per attached Annexure must be followed

## Important Dates

- **September 05, 2025**: Eid-e-Milad holiday, special transaction procedures apply

## Impact Assessment

Medium operational impact on mutual fund trading and settlement processes. Affects timing of order processing and reporting but maintains market functionality during holiday period. Market participants need to adjust their operational procedures accordingly.
