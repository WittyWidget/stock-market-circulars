## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The bonus issue will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10%, improving liquidity and making shares more accessible to retail investors through lower price per share. The 1:10 ratio is moderate and should not significantly dilute per-share metrics since it's proportional to all shareholders.

**Shareholder Impact**: Positive for existing shareholders who receive additional shares without any cost. Post-bonus, share price will adjust proportionally, but total holding value remains unchanged.

**Trading Impact**: Enhanced liquidity expected post-listing on October 20, 2025, as the increased float may attract more market participants.
