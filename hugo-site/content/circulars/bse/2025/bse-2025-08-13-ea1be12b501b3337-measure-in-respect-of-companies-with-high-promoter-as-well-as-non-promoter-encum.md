One security is moving out of the framework while the consolidated list maintains five securities under surveillance.

- Five securities remain in the consolidated surveillance list
- Framework applies to companies with high promoter and non-promoter encumbrance
- Measures are implemented under SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulation 2011

## Regulatory Changes

Effective August 14, 2025:
- Jayaswal Neco Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 522285, ISIN: INE854B01010) will be removed from the encumbrance surveillance framework
- Securities may move out due to inclusion in LT ASM framework (*) or ESM framework ($)
