**Market Impact:** Medium - The auction affects 119 securities with varying quantities, indicating settlement failures across multiple scrips. Large auction quantities in certain stocks (WELCURE DRUG with 54,730 shares, CRIZAC with 16,956 shares) may indicate significant settlement issues.

**Operational Impact:** Clearing members and brokers with shortages in these securities must participate in the auction, which may result in additional costs due to auction prices typically being higher than market prices. The wide range of affected securities suggests settlement issues across different market segments.

**Investor Impact:** Limited direct impact on retail investors, but indicates delivery failures in these securities which may affect market confidence in settlement efficiency for these scrips.
