- Investors should exercise additional caution when trading securities under IBC surveillance
- Companies in IBC surveillance must provide timely disclosures regarding insolvency proceedings

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 15, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of Tasty Dairy Specialities Ltd to Stage 0 surveillance signals potential financial distress and possible insolvency proceedings. This typically results in:

- Increased volatility in the affected security
- Potential liquidity constraints
- Heightened regulatory scrutiny
- Additional disclosure requirements

**Trading Impact**: Securities under IBC surveillance may face:
- Additional margin requirements
- Restricted trading parameters
- Enhanced monitoring by exchange
- Potential migration to higher surveillance stages if insolvency proceedings advance
