## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must execute all transactions in Suraj Industries Limited equity shares on an ex-rights basis with effect from October 13, 2025
- Trading members are required to take note of the record date and ensure proper settlement procedures
- Shareholders holding shares as of the record date (October 13, 2025) will be eligible to participate in the rights issue

## Important Dates

- **October 8, 2025**: Circular notification date
- **October 13, 2025**: Record date for rights issue eligibility
- **October 13, 2025**: Ex-rights trading begins (Settlement DR-734/2025-2026)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The rights issue represents a significant capital raising exercise with a rights ratio of 21:13, which could lead to substantial dilution for non-participating shareholders. The ex-rights trading mechanism ensures proper price adjustment.

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders must decide whether to participate in the rights issue or allow their rights to lapse. The staggered payment structure (application money plus subsequent calls) provides flexibility but requires monitoring of call payment schedules.

**Liquidity Impact**: The stock will trade ex-rights from October 13, 2025, which typically results in a price adjustment reflecting the dilutive effect of the rights issue. Trading volumes may increase around the record date as investors position themselves.
