  Members
---

## Summary

BSE has established a comprehensive framework for empanelment of auditors qualified to conduct system audits of trading members. The framework includes detailed eligibility criteria, undertaking requirements, and ongoing compliance obligations for system auditors.

## Key Points

- Auditors must possess valid CISA(ISACA), DISA(ICAI), CISM(ISACA), or CISSP(ISC2) certifications
- Minimum experience requirements prescribed by BSE/SEBI must be met
- Restrictions apply to new auditors with less than 3 years experience - limited to Type-II category trading members with fewer than 10,000 unique clients
- Firms must maintain at least two certified partners/directors at all times
- For Qualified Stockbrokers (QSBs), firms require at least three certified partners/directors with two being full-time
- Auditors must maintain independence and avoid conflicts of interest
- Geographic location capture required during physical visits for supervision/monitoring

## Regulatory Changes

New requirements include:
- Mandatory geo-location capture during physical audits per SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/TPD/CIR/2025/10 dated January 31, 2025
- Enhanced independence requirements with restrictions on relationships with trading member directors/promoters
- Structured experience-based limitations for junior auditors
- Mandatory training/seminar participation requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- Submit duly notarized undertaking-cum-affidavit on Rs. 500/- stamp paper
- Maintain current professional certifications and registrations
- Comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations
- Verify all areas in BSE system audit checklist with prescribed methodology
- Maintain confidentiality of all audit information and data
- Immediate notification to BSE of any regulatory actions or disciplinary proceedings
- Consent to display contact information on BSE website/portal

## Important Dates

- Framework effective immediately upon circular publication
- Ongoing compliance with updated requirements per SEBI Circular dated January 31, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This framework strengthens the system audit process by:
- Establishing clear professional standards and certification requirements
- Implementing experience-based graduated responsibilities for auditors
- Enhancing supervision and monitoring capabilities through geo-location tracking
- Ensuring auditor independence and conflict-of-interest management
- Creating accountability through comprehensive undertaking requirements

The framework affects all existing and prospective system auditors seeking empanelment with BSE and establishes BSE's authority to de-empanel auditors at its discretion for non-compliance.
