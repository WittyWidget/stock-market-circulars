- Lock-in restrictions apply to all 4,48,889 shares until February 28, 2027
- Shares cannot be transferred or traded by promoters during lock-in period

## Important Dates

- **Trading Commencement**: August 8, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal immediate market impact as shares are subject to promoter lock-in restrictions until 2027. The preferential allotment increases promoter shareholding and strengthens company's equity base. Trading liquidity remains unaffected as locked-in shares cannot be traded in the secondary market.
