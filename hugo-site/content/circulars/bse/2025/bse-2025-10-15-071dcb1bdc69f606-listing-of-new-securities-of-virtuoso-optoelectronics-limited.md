## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notice with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment to non-promoters represents a relatively small issuance pursuant to warrant conversion. The lock-in period until May 30, 2026 ensures these shares will not be available for trading for approximately 7-8 months, limiting near-term supply impact. Trading members should update their records to reflect the increased share capital of Virtuoso Optoelectronics Limited.
