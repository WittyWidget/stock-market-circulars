- Lock-in restrictions must be observed as per the specified schedule
- Shares subject to lock-in cannot be transferred until respective lock-in expiry dates

## Important Dates

- **October 6, 2025**: Notice date
- **October 7, 2025**: Trading commencement date for new securities
- **July 2, 2025**: First allotment (65,82,876 shares)
- **July 21, 2025**: Second allotment (51,85,124 shares)
- **August 1, 2025**: Third allotment (11,00,000 shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 12.87 million shares represents significant equity dilution. The staggered allotment dates across July-August 2025 and lock-in periods extending to 2027 will limit immediate supply. The preferential allotment to both promoters and non-promoters at Rs. 121/- per share indicates confidence in the company's valuation.

**Operational Impact**: Trading volumes may increase once shares become tradeable on October 7, 2025. However, with 100% of new shares under lock-in restrictions until 2026-2027, the immediate free float impact is minimal. Investors should monitor promoter holding changes and dilution effects on existing shareholders' stake percentages.
