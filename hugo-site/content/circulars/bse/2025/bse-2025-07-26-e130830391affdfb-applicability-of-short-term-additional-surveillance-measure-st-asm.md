title: Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) Framework Updates
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective July 28, 2025. Five securities are being added to the ST-ASM framework (Stage I), while four securities are moving out of the framework. The circular provides consolidated lists of all securities currently under the ST-ASM framework with their respective stages.

## Key Points

- 5 new securities added to Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework (Stage I)
- 4 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages
- Comprehensive consolidated list of all securities under ST-ASM provided
- Includes special markings for NSE securities, SME scrips, and T+0 scrips

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to operate with its existing structure of Stage I surveillance measures. Securities under this framework face additional monitoring and potential trading restrictions to ensure market stability and investor protection.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must note the updated list of securities under ST-ASM
- Trading in these securities will be subject to additional surveillance measures
- Brokers and trading members should update their systems to reflect the changes

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 28, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework take effect

## Impact Assessment

The changes affect a limited number of securities with moderate trading impact. Securities moving into ST-ASM may experience reduced liquidity and increased monitoring. The framework serves as a risk management tool to protect investors from excessive price volatility in specific stocks. Market participants should adjust their trading strategies for affected securities accordingly.
