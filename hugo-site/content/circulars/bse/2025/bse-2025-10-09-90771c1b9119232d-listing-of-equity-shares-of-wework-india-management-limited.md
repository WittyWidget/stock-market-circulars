- **April 10, 2027**: Final lock-in expiry (2,77,81,479 shares with 3-year lock-in)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The staggered lock-in expiry schedule will result in gradual increase in free float over the next 2.5 years. The immediate free float of approximately 2.55 crore shares (19% of total) provides reasonable liquidity for initial trading. Investors should monitor lock-in expiry dates as they may impact stock price due to potential selling pressure, particularly on November 6, 2025, when the first significant tranche becomes tradable.

**Liquidity Impact**: The 30-day and 90-day anchor investor lock-ins expiring in November 2025 and January 2026 will add approximately 2.08 crore shares to free float relatively quickly, potentially increasing volatility. The longer lock-in periods extending to April 2027 provide price stability by preventing immediate large-scale selling by promoters and early investors.

**Investor Considerations**: Retail and institutional investors should be aware of the lock-in schedule when making investment decisions, as approximately 81% of shares are currently locked in with systematic release over 2.5 years.
