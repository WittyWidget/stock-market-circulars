## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is a routine government securities auction. The re-issue of existing securities (6.28% GS 2032 and 7.09% GS 2074) provides additional liquidity in the government bond market. The non-competitive bidding facility enables retail and institutional investors to participate without competing on yield, supporting broader market participation in government debt.
