title: Price Band Revisions for 57 Securities Effective October 27, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for 57 securities effective October 27, 2025. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, replacing the existing levels. These changes are part of BSE's surveillance measures to control volatility and manage risk in specific securities. Trading members have been notified to implement these changes from the effective date.

## Key Points

- 57 securities will have revised price bands effective October 27, 2025

- 2 securities have 2% price band: Anirit Ventures Ltd, Genesis Ibrc India Ltd

- 11 securities have 10% price band
- 27 securities have 20% price band
- Changes apply to equity segment trading
- Members can seek clarification at bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Regulatory Changes

The price band mechanism limits the maximum price movement (up or down) that a security can experience during a trading day. Tighter price bands (2%, 5%) indicate higher surveillance and restricted price movement, while wider bands (20%) allow more normal trading. This measure is typically applied to securities exhibiting unusual price volatility, low liquidity, or other risk characteristics requiring enhanced monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement the revised price bands in their trading systems before October 27, 2025
- All trades in the affected securities must comply with the new price band limits from the effective date
- Members should update their risk management systems to reflect the new bands
- Client communication may be necessary for active traders in these securities

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 24, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 27, 2025
- Implementation window: 3 days from notice to effective date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The revised price bands will affect intraday volatility and trading patterns in these 57 securities. Tighter bands (2%, 5%) will limit price discovery and may reduce liquidity, while protecting against excessive volatility. Securities with 2% bands (Anirit Ventures, Genesis Ibrc) face the most restrictive trading environment.

**Investor Impact**: Active traders and investors in these securities need to adjust their trading strategies to account for daily price movement limits. Stop-loss and target prices must be set within the applicable price band. Securities may hit upper or lower circuit limits more frequently under tighter bands.

**Operational Impact**: Brokers and trading members must update their systems, algorithms, and risk management frameworks to incorporate the new bands. Client advisories may be required for holders of these securities to manage expectations regarding price movement constraints.
