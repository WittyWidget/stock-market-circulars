title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective September 11, 2025. The circular details securities being newly added to ST-ASM, those moving between different ASM stages, and securities exiting the framework due to inclusion in other surveillance measures.

## Key Points

- 8 securities newly added to Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework
- 2 securities moving to higher Stage ASM while continuing in ST-ASM
- 8 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework
- Framework includes Stage I securities with enhanced surveillance measures
- Some securities marked with NSE coordination

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework updates
- Securities subject to enhanced surveillance measures including price monitoring
- Movement between different surveillance stages based on trading patterns
- Integration with other frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM, GSM)

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with enhanced surveillance measures for listed securities
- Special attention required for securities in different ASM stages
- Trading members should monitor positions in affected securities
- Compliance with additional reporting requirements for ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: September 11, 2025
- All changes to ST-ASM framework applicable from market opening

## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework affects trading liquidity and investor behavior for the listed securities. Securities under surveillance may experience reduced trading volumes and increased volatility monitoring. Market participants should adjust their trading strategies for affected stocks, particularly those in higher surveillance stages.
