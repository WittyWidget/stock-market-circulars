## Impact Assessment

The preferential allotment increases share capital by approximately 27.85 lakh shares, potentially diluting existing shareholders' holdings. The staggered lock-in periods (2026 and 2027) will restrict immediate selling pressure. Medium impact on stock liquidity and trading volumes expected once trading commences.
