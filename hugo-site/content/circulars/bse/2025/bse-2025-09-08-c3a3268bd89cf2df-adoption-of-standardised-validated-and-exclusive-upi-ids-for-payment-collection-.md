title: Adoption of Standardised, Validated and Exclusive UPI IDs for Payment Collection
  by SEBI Registered Intermediaries
---

## Summary

SEBI has introduced a mandatory structured UPI address mechanism for all registered intermediaries to collect payments from investors. The system uses standardized UPI IDs with unique handles like '@valid' combined with bank names to ensure investors can verify they are paying verified market intermediaries. While usage by investors remains optional, intermediaries must obtain and provide these structured UPI addresses.

## Key Points

- Mandatory for all SEBI-registered investor-facing intermediaries to obtain structured UPI addresses
- UPI addresses will use format: [username].[segment_abbreviation]@valid[bankname]
- Username must be generated using SEBI's dedicated utility tool
- Handle uses unique '@valid' identifier combined with Self-Certified Syndicate Bank names
- Payments will show 'thumbs-up inside green triangle' icon for verification
- Intermediaries must actively promote adoption among investors
- Developed in consultation with NPCI and SCSBs

## Regulatory Changes

- Introduction of structured UPI payment framework for market intermediaries
- Mandatory adoption of standardized UPI address format
- New verification mechanism through dedicated handles and visual indicators
- Enhanced payment security through validated bank account linkage

## Compliance Requirements

- All registered intermediaries must obtain structured UPI addresses
- Must make UPI addresses available to investors
- Must use SEBI's utility for username generation
- Must use approved segment abbreviations (detailed in Annexure B)
- Must actively promote mechanism adoption among investors
- Market Infrastructure Institutions, RTAs, and SCSBs must facilitate implementation

## Important Dates

- Circular issued: June 11, 2025
- Implementation timeline to be specified in subsequent communications

## Impact Assessment

- Affects all SEBI-registered intermediaries including brokers, mutual funds, and other investor-facing entities
- Enhances investor confidence through payment verification system
- Requires system changes and investor education by intermediaries
- Streamlines payment collection while maintaining security
- May require coordination with banks and payment service providers
