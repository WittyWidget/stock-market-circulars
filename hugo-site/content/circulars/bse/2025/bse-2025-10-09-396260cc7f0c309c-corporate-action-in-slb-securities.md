## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects liquidity in the SLB segment for four securities during their respective shut periods.

**Operational Impact:** Participants holding SLB positions in these securities must take action to close or roll over positions before foreclosure dates. The spin-offs for SKF India and Tata Motors require particular attention as they involve fundamental changes to the security structure.

**Trading Impact:** Securities will not be available for lending or borrowing during shut periods, potentially affecting hedging and arbitrage strategies.

**Investor Impact:** SLB participants with open positions must monitor these dates carefully to avoid forced closures or penalties. The concentration of multiple corporate actions within a two-week period requires active position management.
