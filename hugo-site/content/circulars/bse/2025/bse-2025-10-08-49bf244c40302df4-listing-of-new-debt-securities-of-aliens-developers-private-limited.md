## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of privately placed debt securities with a low credit rating (IND D) indicating substantial default risk. The securities are zero-coupon instruments with no put/call options, limiting their appeal to specialized investors. The total issue size of Rs. 18.6 crore (1,860 Ã— Rs. 100,000) represents a small debt issuance unlikely to impact broader market dynamics. Trading will be restricted to dematerialized form only, affecting only specialized debt market participants.
