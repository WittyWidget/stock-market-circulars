This follows the company's SME IPO listing and represents a standard progression in trading classification.

- **October 24, 2025**: Effective date for transfer to Rolling segment (M Group)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The transition from Trade for Trade to Rolling settlement typically improves liquidity and trading volumes as it allows for intraday trading and reduces settlement obligations. This is positive for investor participation.

**Operational Impact**: Low to Medium - Trading members need to update internal systems and processes to accommodate the group change, but this is a routine operational adjustment.

**Investor Impact**: Positive - Investors will benefit from enhanced liquidity, ability to execute intraday trades, and reduced margin requirements compared to the T2T segment.
