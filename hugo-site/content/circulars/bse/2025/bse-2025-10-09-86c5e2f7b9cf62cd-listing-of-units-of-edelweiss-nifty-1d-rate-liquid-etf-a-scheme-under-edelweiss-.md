The Edelweiss Nifty 1D Rate Liquid ETF provides investors with an exchange-traded option for exposure to overnight rates with low interest rate and credit risk. The initial listing size of 149,992 units (face value Rs. 1,000 each) represents approximately Rs. 15 crore in initial issuance. The presence of two market makers (Kanjalochana Finserve and Cholamandalam Securities) should ensure adequate liquidity.
