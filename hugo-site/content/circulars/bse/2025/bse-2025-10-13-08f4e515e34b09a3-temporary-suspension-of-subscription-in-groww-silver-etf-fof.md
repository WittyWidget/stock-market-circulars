## Summary

Groww Asset Management has temporarily suspended all fresh subscriptions and switch-in transactions for Groww Silver ETF FOF effective October 13, 2025 at 3:00 PM.

The scheme invests in units of Groww Silver ETF which tracks domestic silver prices, making the premium directly impact scheme valuation. Redemptions and switch-outs will continue normally.

- Transactions received after 3:00 PM on October 13, 2025 will not be accepted
- Existing and new scheme facilities like SIP, SWP, and STP are not affected
- Redemptions and switch-outs will continue as per normal terms in the SID
- Suspension is temporary and will remain until further notice
- Domestic silver is trading at a premium to international prices due to physical silver shortage

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational measure taken by the fund house in response to market conditions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Notice cum addendum forms integral part of Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)
- All other terms and conditions in SID and KIM remain unchanged
- Investors encouraged to register/update email and mobile number for paperless communications under Go Green Initiative

## Important Dates

- **October 13, 2025**: Effective date of suspension notice
- **Until further notice**: Duration of temporary suspension

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Reflects significant market dislocation with domestic silver trading at premium to international prices due to physical supply shortage. This creates valuation concerns for schemes tracking domestic silver prices.

**Investor Impact**: High - New investors and existing investors looking to add units cannot subscribe until suspension is lifted. However, existing investors can continue redemptions and systematic transactions (SIP/SWP/STP) remain operational.

**Operational Impact**: The suspension protects existing unitholders from dilution that could occur if new subscriptions were accepted at artificially inflated domestic silver prices. Fund house prioritizing fair valuation over asset gathering.
