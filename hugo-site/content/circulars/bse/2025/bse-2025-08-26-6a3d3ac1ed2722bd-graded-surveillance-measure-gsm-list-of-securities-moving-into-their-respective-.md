title: Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) - Securities Moving to Different GSM Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the movement of 8 securities into different stages of the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework. This includes one security moving to Stage I, two to Stage II, one to Stage III, and four securities advancing to the most restrictive Stage IV surveillance.

## Key Points

- 8 securities are being moved to enhanced surveillance stages
- Stage IV (highest surveillance) applies to 4 companies: SJ Corporation Ltd., Mehta Securities Ltd., Satiate Agri Limited, and Tacent Projects Limited
- Stage I surveillance applies to Otco International Ltd.
- Stage II surveillance applies to International Data Management and Ecoboard Industries Ltd.
- Stage III surveillance applies to Pioneer Agro Extracts Ltd.
- Securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM or IBC frameworks

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of enhanced surveillance measures across different GSM stages based on risk assessment criteria. Securities in higher GSM stages face stricter trading restrictions and monitoring.

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must comply with enhanced disclosure requirements
- Trading members must ensure adherence to surveillance-specific trading restrictions
- Investors should be aware of additional risks associated with GSM securities

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: August 26, 2025 (as per circular date)

## Impact Assessment

Companies moved to higher GSM stages may experience reduced trading volumes and liquidity. Stage IV surveillance represents the highest level of monitoring and may significantly impact investor sentiment and stock performance. The measure aims to protect investor interests while maintaining market integrity.
