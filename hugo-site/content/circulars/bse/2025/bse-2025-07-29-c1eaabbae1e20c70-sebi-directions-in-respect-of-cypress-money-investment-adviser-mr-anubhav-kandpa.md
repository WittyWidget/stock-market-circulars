- Trading accounts to be unfrozen immediately
- Covers Cypress Money Investment Adviser (PAN: AAKFC7589G) and three individuals
- Follows up on original Exchange Notice from May 4, 2018

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular represents the conclusion of previous enforcement action.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must unfreeze accounts of the specified entities
- Ensure immediate compliance with SEBI's directive
- Take note of the updated status of these entities

## Important Dates

- **July 29, 2025**: SEBI directive issued
