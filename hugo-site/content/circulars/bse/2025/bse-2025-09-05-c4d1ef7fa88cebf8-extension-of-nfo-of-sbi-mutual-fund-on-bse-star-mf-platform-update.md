title: Extension of NFO of SBI Mutual Fund on BSE StAR MF Platform - UPDATE
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the extension of the New Fund Offer (NFO) for SBI Dynamic Asset Allocation Active Fund of Funds (FOF) on the BSE StAR MF Platform. The NFO closure date has been extended by one day from September 08, 2025 to September 09, 2025. This update modifies the previously communicated NFO schedule and provides specific timelines for fund payments, transaction cancellations, and unit allotment.

## Key Points

- NFO extended from September 08, 2025 to September 09, 2025 (midnight)
- Extension applies only to lumpsum purchases on BSE StAR MF Platform
- Transactions without client-initiated funds by 9:00 AM on T+1 day will be cancelled
- Tentative allotment date confirmed as September 15, 2025
- Clear funds must be available in ICCL Account by 6:00 PM on September 12, 2025
- Transactions with initiated payments remain pending until 3:00 PM on last day of fund payout or T+5, whichever is earlier
- SIP/XSIP registration authentication must be completed by clients before 3:00 PM on NFO closure date
- SMART NFO switches triggered to AMC/RTA on September 05, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an operational update extending the NFO period for a specific mutual fund scheme.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Members:**
- Ensure client transactions have funds initiated by 9:00 AM on T+1 day to avoid cancellation
- Report cancelled transactions (CC with N flag) to RTA/AMC
- Ensure clear funds availability in ICCL Account by 6:00 PM on September 12, 2025

**For Investors:**
- Complete SIP/XSIP registration authentication before 3:00 PM on September 09, 2025 (NFO closure date)
- Initiate fund payments timely to avoid transaction cancellation
- For switches: ensure funds under switch-out scheme are received before allotment date for NFO consideration

**Payment Methods:**
- Cheques and OTM payments acceptable during NFO period
- Subject to receipt of clear funds in ICCL account by 6:00 PM on September 12, 2025

## Important Dates

- **September 05, 2025**: Notice date; SMART NFO switches triggered to AMC/RTA
- **September 09, 2025 (midnight)**: Extended NFO closure date for lumpsum purchases
- **September 09, 2025 (3:00 PM)**: Deadline for SIP/XSIP registration authentication
- **September 12, 2025 (6:00 PM)**: Deadline for clear funds in ICCL Account
- **September 15, 2025**: Tentative allotment date
- **T+1 day (9:00 AM)**: Deadline for clients to initiate funds (transactions without initiated funds will be cancelled)
- **Last day of fund payout or T+5 (3:00 PM)**: Pending transactions deadline (whichever is earlier)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to medium. The one-day extension provides additional time for investors to participate in the SBI Dynamic Asset Allocation Active FOF NFO, potentially increasing subscription volumes.

**Operational Impact:** Medium. Members need to manage the extended timeline and ensure compliance with fund payment deadlines. The strict cut-off times for fund initiation (9:00 AM T+1) and clear funds availability (6:00 PM September 12, 2025) require careful operational coordination.

**Investor Impact:** Medium. Investors gain an additional day to participate in the NFO. However, they must be aware of specific deadlines for fund payments, SIP/XSIP authentication, and switch transactions to ensure successful allotment. The requirement for clear funds by September 12, 2025 for a September 15, 2025 allotment provides a tight timeline for payment processing.
