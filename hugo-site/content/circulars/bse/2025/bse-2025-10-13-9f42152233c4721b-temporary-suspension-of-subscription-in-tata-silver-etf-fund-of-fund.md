## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The suspension reflects broader domestic silver market conditions where physical silver shortage has caused domestic prices to trade at a premium relative to international prices. This premium directly impacts the scheme's valuation.

**Investor Impact:** Investors seeking to make new investments in Tata Silver ETF Fund of Fund through lumpsum, switch-in, or fresh SIP/STP registrations will be unable to do so during the suspension period. However, investors with existing SIP/STP commitments can continue their investments, and all investors retain full redemption rights.

**Operational Impact:** The fund house maintains normal operations for redemptions and existing systematic plans, limiting disruption to ongoing investor relationships while protecting the scheme from potential adverse impacts of premium pricing in domestic silver markets.
