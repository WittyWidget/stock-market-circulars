title: Processing of Waiver Applications by Exchanges for Commonly Listed Entities
---

## Summary

BSE has issued guidance clarifying scenarios where waiver or reduction of fines will not be considered for commonly listed entities. The circular provides an illustrative list of non-acceptable scenarios for three key regulatory violations under SEBI LODR regulations.

## Key Points

- Specifies scenarios that do not qualify for waiver of fines under SEBI LODR regulations
- Covers three major compliance areas: company secretary appointment, investor complaint reporting, and board composition
- Emphasizes that certain common excuses will not be accepted for waiver applications

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular clarifies existing waiver application processing standards.

## Compliance Requirements

**Regulation 6(1) - Company Secretary Appointment (₹1,000/day fine):**
- Must appoint qualified company secretary as compliance officer within three months of vacancy
- Must provide documentary evidence of efforts to appoint new CS within prescribed timeframe
- Must specify valid reasons for any delayed compliance in waiver applications

**Regulation 13(3) - Shareholder Complaints Statement (₹1,000/day fine):**
- Submit quarterly statement on investor complaints within prescribed period
- Cannot cite non-receipt of data from RTA/Depository as excuse
- Must ensure compliance despite officer resignations or unavailability

**Regulation 17(1) - Board Composition (₹5,000/day fine):**
- Maintain optimum combination of executive and non-executive directors
- Ensure at least one woman director (top 1000 entities need independent woman director)
- At least 50% non-executive directors required
- Top 2000 entities must have minimum six directors

## Important Dates

- Three-month deadline for company secretary appointment after vacancy
- Quarterly submission deadlines for investor complaint statements

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects procedural compliance rather than trading operations

**Operational Impact:** High for non-compliant entities - Stricter enforcement of existing regulations with reduced scope for waivers

**Compliance Impact:** High - Listed entities must ensure robust compliance processes and cannot rely on common excuses for delays
