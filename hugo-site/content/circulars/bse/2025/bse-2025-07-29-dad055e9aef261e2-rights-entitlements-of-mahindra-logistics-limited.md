- Market Lot: 1, Group: R
- Settlement: T+1 Rolling Settlement basis, trade-for-trade
- Trading only in dematerialized form

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. Existing framework for rights entitlements trading applies as per previous notices dated March 05, 2020 and May 18, 2020.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform clients about RE trading commencement
- Contract notes must include prominent disclaimer about RE purchase rights
- Trading members must clarify that REs are not ordinary shares
- Clients must be informed that REs give right to participate in rights issue or renounce before closure

## Important Dates

- **July 31, 2025**: Rights Entitlements trading begins, Rights Issue opens
- **August 11, 2025**: Last day for RE renunciation trading
- **August 14, 2025**: Rights Issue closes
- **After Issue Closing Date**: Unsubscribed and unrenounced REs will lapse

## Impact Assessment

Moderate impact on Mahindra Logistics shareholders who can now trade their rights entitlements instead of letting them lapse. Provides liquidity and flexibility for shareholders who may not wish to subscribe to the rights issue directly.
