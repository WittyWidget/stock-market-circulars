- Potential trading restrictions based on ESM stage
- Periodic review for stage progression or exit

Securities can move between ESM stages or exit the framework based on ongoing surveillance parameters.

## Compliance Requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 28, 2025 - New ESM inclusions and stage changes take effect
- **Circular Date**: October 27, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - ESM inclusion typically results in reduced liquidity and increased volatility for affected securities. The framework serves as a warning signal to investors about securities exhibiting unusual price movements or other surveillance concerns.

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ESM face enhanced scrutiny and may be subject to additional margin requirements, position limits, or other trading restrictions depending on the ESM stage. Movement to higher ESM stages increases these restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should exercise increased caution. ESM classification indicates heightened regulatory concern and may affect the ease of entry/exit from positions.

- Bits Ltd (526709)
- Cargotrans Maritime Ltd (543618) - SME
- Emergent Industrial Solutions Ltd (506180)
- Nivaka Fashions Ltd (542206)
- Ontic Finserve Ltd (540386)
- Times Green Energy (India) Ltd (543310) - SME

**Securities with Increased Surveillance**:
- Nidhi Granites Ltd (512103) - Moving to higher ESM stage indicates continued surveillance concerns
