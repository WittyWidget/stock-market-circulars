The new securities will be available for trading from Friday, October 10, 2025.

None of these securities are subject to lock-in restrictions.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes are introduced in this circular. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the listing of these additional securities
- The new shares are immediately available for trading without restrictions
- Companies must ensure compliance with existing ESOP/ESOS regulations and SEBI guidelines

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 9, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date:** Friday, October 10, 2025
- **Lock-in Period:** Not Applicable (NA) for all listed securities

## Impact Assessment

The market impact of this listing is minimal as the number of shares being listed represents a small fraction of the total outstanding shares for each company. ESOP/ESOS listings are routine corporate actions that provide liquidity to employees who have exercised their stock options. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares can be traded immediately, though the volumes are not significant enough to materially affect stock prices or market operations. This is a standard administrative notification with no broader market implications.
