## Summary

BSE has announced corporate actions for 16 securities scheduled between September 10-22, 2025. This includes 15 dividend distributions and 1 stock split (Adani Power Limited). All securities will have corresponding shut periods for SLB (Securities Lending and Borrowing) operations.

## Key Points

- 15 companies declaring dividends with record dates from September 10-19, 2025
- Adani Power Limited announcing stock split with record date September 22, 2025
- All securities subject to SLB shut periods coinciding with record dates
- Ex-dates align with record dates for all corporate actions
- Share India Securities has the earliest action date (September 10, 2025)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. Standard corporate action procedures apply as per existing BSE guidelines.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors must hold securities before ex-date to be eligible for dividends
- SLB operations will be suspended during specified shut periods
- Stock split adjustment will apply to Adani Power Limited securities

## Impact Assessment

Moderate market impact expected due to multiple dividend distributions creating buying interest before ex-dates. Adani Power stock split may increase liquidity and retail participation. SLB shut periods will temporarily restrict securities lending activities, potentially affecting short-term trading strategies. Investors should plan positions accordingly to capture dividend benefits.
