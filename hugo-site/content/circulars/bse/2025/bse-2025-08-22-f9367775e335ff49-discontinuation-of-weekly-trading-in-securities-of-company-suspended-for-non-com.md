---

## Summary

BSE announces the discontinuation of weekly trading facility for Gangotri Textiles Limited (Scrip Code: 521176) effective September 9, 2025. This follows the completion of the mandatory six-month period during which the company's shares were allowed to trade on a Trade for Trade basis in Z group only on the first trading day of each week, following suspension for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations.

## Key Points

- Gangotri Textiles Limited (Scrip Code: 521176) will lose weekly trading facility
- Company was previously suspended for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations 2015
- Weekly trading facility was provided as per SEBI Master Circular dated November 11, 2024
- Trading was restricted to Trade for Trade basis in Z group on first trading day of each week
- Six-month mandated period has been completed

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of SEBI Master Circular No. SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024, Chapter-VII(A) regarding Penal Actions for Non-Compliance with Standard Operating Procedure for suspension and revocation of equity shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading Members must note the discontinuation of weekly trading facility
- No further trading will be allowed for Gangotri Textiles Limited after September 9, 2025
- Queries can be directed to bse.soplodr@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **January 20, 2025**: Original suspension notice issued
- **September 9, 2025**: Effective date for discontinuation of weekly trading facility
- **Six months**: Completion of mandated trading period

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this affects only one previously suspended company with restricted trading. The discontinuation follows standard regulatory procedures for non-compliant entities, with minimal effect on overall market operations. Investors holding shares in Gangotri Textiles Limited will lose the limited weekly trading opportunity.
