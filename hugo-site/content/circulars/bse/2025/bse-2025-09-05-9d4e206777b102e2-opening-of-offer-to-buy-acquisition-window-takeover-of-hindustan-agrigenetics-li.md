## Impact Assessment

This is a high-impact corporate action involving change in control and management of Hindustan Agrigenetics Limited. The open offer for 26% equity stake represents a significant ownership restructuring. Shareholders must carefully review the Letter of Offer and decide whether to tender their shares at the offered price of ₹54 per share. The offer is not subject to minimum acceptance levels, providing certainty to participating shareholders. As no statutory approvals are currently required but may become applicable before completion, shareholders should monitor developments. The absence of competing offers as of the circular date means shareholders face a single offer scenario, though competitive bids could potentially emerge during the offer period.
