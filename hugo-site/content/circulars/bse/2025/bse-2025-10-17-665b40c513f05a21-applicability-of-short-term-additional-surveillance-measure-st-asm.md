## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework applies additional surveillance measures to securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or excessive volatility. Securities in this framework face trading restrictions designed to protect investors and maintain market integrity. The movement of 14 securities out of ST-ASM (some into stricter frameworks like Trade for Trade or LT-ASM) and addition of 10 new securities reflects ongoing market surveillance activities. Traders and investors in these securities should be aware of the applicable restrictions and monitoring requirements.
