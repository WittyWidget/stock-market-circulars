title: Listing of Further Securities Issued Under ESOP/ESOS Schemes
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular detailing the listing of further securities issued by companies under Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). The circular provides information about lock-in periods, share quantities, and distribution details for newly issued securities.

## Key Points

- Total of 302,000 shares issued under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Lock-in expiry dates primarily on August 29-30, 2025
- Securities distributed across multiple distribution categories
- Standard ESOP/ESOS listing procedures followed

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes mentioned in this circular. This appears to be a routine administrative notification for ESOP/ESOS securities listing.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must comply with standard ESOP/ESOS listing requirements
- Lock-in periods must be observed as specified
- Proper distribution and allocation procedures to be followed

## Important Dates

- Lock-in expiry dates: August 29, 2025 and August 30, 2025
- Various distribution periods as specified in the detailed schedule

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected as this is a routine administrative process for ESOP/ESOS securities. The listing of these securities follows standard procedures and represents normal corporate activity related to employee compensation schemes. The relatively small quantity of shares (302,000 total) suggests limited immediate market impact.
