## Summary

The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) Mumbai has admitted Appeal No. 457 of 2025 filed by MAN Industries India Limited and others against a SEBI order. The Tribunal has granted interim relief by staying the debarment order that prevented the company from accessing securities markets for two years. The appellants are required to deposit 50% of the total penalty amount of Rs. 1 crore (i.e., Rs. 50 lakhs) within two weeks in a fixed deposit with lien marked to SEBI. The matter relates to an investigation covering the period 2014 to 2021, with show cause notice issued in 2022.

## Important Dates

- **October 10, 2025**: Date of SAT order
- **October 24, 2025**: Deadline for depositing 50% penalty amount (two weeks from order date)
- **November 21, 2025**: Deadline for SEBI to file reply (six weeks from order date)
- **December 12, 2025**: Deadline for appellants to file rejoinder (three weeks after SEBI's reply)
- **January 20, 2026**: Next hearing date (by consent)

## Impact Assessment

**Company Impact**: MAN Industries India Limited has obtained significant interim relief as the stay on debarment allows the company to continue accessing securities markets while the appeal is pending. However, the company must immediately arrange Rs. 50 lakhs as penalty deposit.

**Market Impact**: The stay prevents disruption to the company's market operations and preserves its ability to raise capital and conduct securities transactions during the appeal period.

**Legal Precedent**: The SAT's reasoning that debarment periods cannot be "undergone" and reversed if appeal succeeds provides important guidance on interim relief in market access restriction cases.

**Investor Consideration**: Investors should note that while the debarment is stayed, the underlying allegations from the 2014-2021 investigation remain unresolved and will be adjudicated in the appeal process. The eventual outcome could result in reinstatement of the debarment if the appeal is dismissed.
