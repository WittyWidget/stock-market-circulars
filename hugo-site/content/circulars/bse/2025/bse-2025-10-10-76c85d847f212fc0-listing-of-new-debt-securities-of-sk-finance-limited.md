## Impact Assessment

This is a routine debt security listing with minimal market-wide impact. The listing provides SK Finance Limited access to debt capital markets and offers institutional investors an investment option with AA- credit rating. The private placement nature indicates limited retail investor participation. Trading members should note the high face value (Rs. 1 lakh per unit) which typically restricts participation to institutional and high net-worth investors.
