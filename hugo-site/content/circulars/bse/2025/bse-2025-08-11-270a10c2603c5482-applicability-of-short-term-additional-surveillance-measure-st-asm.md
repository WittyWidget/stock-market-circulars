## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective August 12, 2025. Five securities are being newly shortlisted, three securities are moving out of the framework, and a consolidated list of 17 securities currently under ST-ASM Stage I is provided.

## Key Points

- 5 new securities added to ST-ASM framework: Abram Food Ltd, Hit Kit Global Solutions Ltd, National Securities Depository Ltd, Pioneer Investcorp Ltd, and Quadrant Televentures Ltd
- 3 securities moving out of ST-ASM: Panchsheel Organics Ltd, Rajkot Investment Trust Ltd, and TANFAC Industries Ltd
- No securities moving to higher or lower stages within the framework
- All securities currently under Stage I of Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure changes affecting trading parameters for specified securities. Securities under ST-ASM framework are subject to enhanced monitoring and specific trading restrictions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with ST-ASM trading restrictions for newly added securities
- Enhanced surveillance measures apply to all listed securities under the framework
- Special marking applies to SME scrips (@) and T+0 scrips (~) as per parent company classification

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 12, 2025 - All ST-ASM framework changes become applicable

Securities moving into the framework may experience reduced trading flexibility, while those moving out gain normal trading status. The consolidated list helps market participants identify all securities currently under enhanced surveillance.
