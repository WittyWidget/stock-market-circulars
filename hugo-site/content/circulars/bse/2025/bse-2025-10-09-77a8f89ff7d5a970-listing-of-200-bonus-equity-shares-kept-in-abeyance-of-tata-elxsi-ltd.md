## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. The release of 200 bonus shares from abeyance represents a negligible quantity relative to Tata Elxsi's total share capital. This is primarily an administrative action to regularize shares that were previously kept in abeyance, likely pending resolution of shareholder-specific issues. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the additional tradable shares.
