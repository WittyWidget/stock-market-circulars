title: Corporate Actions in SLB Securities - Dividend and Stock Split Updates
---

## Summary

BSE has announced corporate actions for 16 securities in the SLB (Securities Lending and Borrowing) segment, including 15 dividend declarations and 1 stock split. The actions have record dates ranging from September 10-22, 2025, with corresponding ex-dates and shut periods.

## Key Points

- 15 companies declaring dividends with record dates between September 10-19, 2025
- Adani Power Limited announcing stock split with record date September 22, 2025
- All corporate actions have corresponding shut periods for SLB securities
- Ex-dates align with record dates for all announced actions
- Share India Securities and Edelweiss have earliest dates (September 10-11)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced - this is a standard corporate action notification for SLB securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- SLB participants must note shut periods for affected securities
- No lending/borrowing allowed during specified shut periods
- Market participants should adjust positions before ex-dates
- Settlement implications for open SLB positions during corporate action periods

## Important Dates

- **September 10, 2025**: Share India Securities dividend (ex-date and record date)
- **September 11, 2025**: Edelweiss Financial Services dividend (ex-date and record date)
- **September 12, 2025**: Vardhman Textiles and Gallantt Ispat dividends
- **September 17, 2025**: Prakash Industries, TANFAC Industries, and Sanghvi Movers dividends
- **September 18, 2025**: Multiple companies including Jamna Auto, Goodluck India, Poly Medicure, GMDC
- **September 19, 2025**: Monarch Networth, Balu Forge, Sansera Engineering, Syrma SGS dividends
- **September 22, 2025**: Adani Power stock split

## Impact Assessment

Moderate impact on SLB market operations with temporary restrictions on lending/borrowing for affected securities. The staggered dates help minimize market disruption. Adani Power's stock split may require additional attention due to ratio adjustments in SLB positions. Market participants should plan position adjustments well in advance of shut periods.
