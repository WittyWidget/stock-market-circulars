## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies to specific commercial papers only
- Two companies affected: Standard Chartered Securities and BHEL
- Suspension is due to record date fixation for redemption
- Different record dates for different commercial papers

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes - this is a standard operational procedure for commercial paper redemptions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified commercial papers from the no-dealings date
- Compliance with record date procedures for redemption

## Important Dates

- **BHEL-25-8-25-CP (INE257A14961)**: Record Date 22/08/2025, No dealings from 22/08/2025

Limited impact as this affects only specific commercial papers scheduled for redemption. This is a routine operational measure that ensures proper settlement of maturing commercial papers. Trading in other securities of these companies remains unaffected.
