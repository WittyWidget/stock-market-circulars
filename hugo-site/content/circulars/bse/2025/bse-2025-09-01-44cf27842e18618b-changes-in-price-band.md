title: Price Band Revisions for 15 Securities Effective September 2, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced price band revisions for 15 securities effective from September 2, 2025. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, with most securities having restrictions between 5% to 10%. This measure is part of BSE's surveillance framework to manage price volatility.

## Key Points

- 15 securities will have revised price bands from September 2, 2025
- Price band percentages range from 2% (lowest) to 20% (highest)
- Star Imaging And Path Lab Ltd has the highest restriction at 20%
- Kuber Udyog Ltd and Tamilnadu Steel Tubes Ltd have the lowest at 2%
- Most securities (7 out of 15) have been assigned a 5% price band

## Regulatory Changes

Price band restrictions have been modified for the following securities:
- 2% band: Kuber Udyog Ltd, Tamilnadu Steel Tubes Ltd
- 5% band: Dhyaani Tradeventtures Ltd, Gujarat Apollo Industries Ltd, Lotus Eye Hospital And Institute Ltd, Parmeshwari Silk Mills Ltd, Pecos Hotels and Pubs Ltd, Prospect Consumer Products Ltd, Wardwizard Foods and Beverages Ltd

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: September 1, 2025
- **Effective Date**: September 2, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will limit intraday price movements for these securities, potentially reducing volatility but also constraining price discovery. Securities with tighter bands (2-5%) will have more restricted trading ranges, while those with wider bands (10-20%) will have relatively more flexibility. This is a standard surveillance measure to maintain market stability for securities that may have experienced excessive volatility.
