Traders and investors in these securities must be aware of the ex-dates for dividend entitlement. Securities will trade ex-dividend on the specified ex-dates, meaning purchasers on or after these dates will not be entitled to the declared dividends. The shut periods will affect settlement cycles for these securities during the specified timeframes.
