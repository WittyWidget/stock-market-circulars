## Summary

BSE has updated the Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) for companies under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). Two securities - Indosolar Ltd and Ujaas Energy Ltd - have been moved to Stage 1 surveillance effective August 11, 2025. The circular provides comprehensive lists of securities at various IBC surveillance stages.

- No securities moved to Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure)
- No securities moved from Stage I to Stage II or vice versa
- No securities excluded from ASM for IBC
- Consolidated list includes 14+ companies across different IBC surveillance stages

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of stage-wise surveillance framework for companies under IBC proceedings, with different levels of monitoring based on insolvency status and corporate disclosures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies under IBC surveillance must comply with enhanced disclosure requirements
- Securities marked with (*) follow NSE guidelines
- T+0 scrips marked with (~) are subject to parent company IBC framework
- Market participants must adhere to specific trading conditions for listed securities

## Important Dates
