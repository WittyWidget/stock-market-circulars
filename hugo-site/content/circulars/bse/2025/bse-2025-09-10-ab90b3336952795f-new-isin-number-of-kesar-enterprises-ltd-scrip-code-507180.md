## Regulatory Changes

Assignment of new ISIN number to reflect the changed face value of equity shares post sub-division, ensuring proper identification in trading and settlement systems.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number
- All trades from September 18, 2025 onwards must use the new ISIN INE133B01027

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on trading operations as market participants need to update systems and records.

Trading systems, depository records, and investor portfolios will need updates to reflect the new ISIN and share structure.
