## Summary

BSE has announced dividend distributions and corresponding shut periods for 23 companies in the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) segment. The corporate actions span from September 4, 2025 to September 23, 2025, with each security having designated book closure dates, ex-dates, and shut periods during which SLB transactions will be suspended.

## Key Points

- 23 companies announcing dividend distributions in September 2025
- SLB transactions will be suspended during designated shut periods for each security
- Shut periods typically span 1-3 days around the record/ex-date
- Ex-dates range from September 4 to September 23, 2025
- All corporate actions are dividend distributions

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes announced. Standard SLB suspension procedures apply during corporate action periods.

## Compliance Requirements

- SLB participants must close or roll over positions before shut period commencement
- No new SLB transactions permitted during shut periods
- Lenders and borrowers must ensure compliance with settlement obligations before shut periods
- Market participants should adjust their SLB strategies accordingly

## Important Dates

- Earliest Ex-Date: September 4, 2025 (Supriya Lifescience Limited)
- Latest Ex-Date: September 23, 2025 (Mold-Tek Packaging Limited)
- Shut periods range from September 3-5, 2025 to September 22-23, 2025

Normal trading in cash segment remains unaffected. The staggered dates allow market participants to manage their SLB portfolios without simultaneous disruptions across all securities.
