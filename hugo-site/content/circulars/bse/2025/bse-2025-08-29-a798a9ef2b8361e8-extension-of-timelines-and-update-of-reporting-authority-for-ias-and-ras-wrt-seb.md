## Impact Assessment

The timeline extensions provide relief to regulated entities struggling to meet the original deadlines for digital accessibility compliance. The consolidation of reporting for IAs and RAs under BSE Ltd. streamlines the regulatory process and reduces administrative burden. This affects all digital platforms used by these entities to serve investors, potentially requiring significant technical upgrades to meet accessibility standards.
