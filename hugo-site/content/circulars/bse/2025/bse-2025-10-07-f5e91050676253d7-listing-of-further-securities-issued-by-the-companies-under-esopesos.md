## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - The issuance represents routine ESOP/ESOS conversions with minimal dilution effect on existing shareholding patterns. The total number of shares being listed is relatively small compared to the paid-up capital of these companies.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible - Most securities have no lock-in period, though their immediate trading volumes are expected to be limited given the employee-related nature of the issuance.

**Investor Impact:** Minimal - Existing investors may see marginal dilution in their holdings, but the impact is immaterial given the small quantum of shares relative to total outstanding equity.
