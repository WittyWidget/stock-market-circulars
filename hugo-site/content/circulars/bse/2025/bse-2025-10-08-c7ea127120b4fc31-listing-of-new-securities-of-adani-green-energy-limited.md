## Impact Assessment

This preferential allotment increases Adani Green Energy's equity base by 54,55,584 shares, raising approximately Rs. 807.85 crores (at issue price of Rs. 1,480.75 per share). The allotment strengthens promoter holding as shares were issued exclusively to the promoter group. The 18-month lock-in period (from allotment to April 2027) ensures promoter commitment. Market impact is moderate as this represents expansion of equity capital with funds raised through warrant conversion, typical in growth-focused renewable energy companies.
