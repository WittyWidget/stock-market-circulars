## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 06, 2025
- **Effective Date:** October 07, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The revised price bands will restrict intraday price movements for these 14 securities. Tighter bands (2% and 5%) indicate higher surveillance concerns and will limit volatility but may also reduce liquidity. The 10% band securities have more trading flexibility but are still under monitoring.

**Trading Impact:** Investors and traders in these securities will face circuit filter hits more frequently if price movements are volatile. This may affect intraday trading strategies and limit speculation in these scrips.

**Surveillance Context:** The revision suggests these securities have exhibited unusual price movements or trading patterns that warrant enhanced monitoring and volatility controls.
