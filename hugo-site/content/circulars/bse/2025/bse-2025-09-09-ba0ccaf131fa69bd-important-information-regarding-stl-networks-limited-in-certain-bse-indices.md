title: STL Networks Limited Exclusion from BSE Indices Effective September 11, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE Index Services Private Ltd announced the exclusion of STL Networks Limited (Scrip code: 544395) from multiple BSE indices effective September 11, 2025. This action follows the company's failure to hit the lower circuit on September 8-9, 2025, as part of the demerger scheme arrangement process.

## Key Points

- STL Networks Limited (Scrip code: 544395) will be excluded from 8 BSE indices
- Exclusion effective prior to trading opening on September 11, 2025
- Decision based on company not hitting lower circuit on September 8-9, 2025
- Action follows previously announced demerger scheme arrangement process
- Corporate action included in end-of-day file (*.SDE)

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of BSE Index Services' previously announced process (Notice No: 20250403-46) for removal of spun-off scrips from BSE Indices following demerger schemes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Index fund managers need to adjust portfolios to exclude STL Networks Limited
- Market participants should note the exclusion for trading and investment strategies
- Queries can be directed to bseindex@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **September 8-9, 2025**: Monitoring period for lower circuit hits
- **September 11, 2025**: Effective date for index exclusion (prior to market opening)

## Impact Assessment

The exclusion affects investors and funds tracking the impacted indices. Index funds will need to rebalance portfolios, potentially creating selling pressure on the stock. The exclusion from 8 major indices including BSE SMALLCAP and BSE ALLCAP reduces the stock's visibility and accessibility to passive investment flows.
