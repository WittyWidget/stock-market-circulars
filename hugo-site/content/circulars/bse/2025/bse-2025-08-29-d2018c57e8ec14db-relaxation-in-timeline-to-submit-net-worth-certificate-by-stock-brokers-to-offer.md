- Decision made to promote ease of doing business based on market participant representations

## Regulatory Changes

- Para 4.5.3 of Chapter 1 of Master Circular for Stock Exchanges and Clearing Corporations (SECC) dated December 30, 2024 modified
- New submission deadlines: May 31 (for March 31 certificates) and November 15 (for September 30 certificates)
- Timeline harmonization with existing financial reporting requirements

## Compliance Requirements

- Certificates must confirm net worth as on March 31 and September 30
- Stock exchanges must make necessary amendments to bye-laws, rules and regulations
- Stock exchanges to notify members and publish on websites

## Important Dates
