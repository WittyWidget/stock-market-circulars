## Impact Assessment

This preferential allotment represents a significant capital raise for Centrum Capital Limited at a substantial premium to face value. The issuance of approximately 4.35 crore shares will result in equity dilution for existing shareholders. The 18-month lock-in period (from allotment date) provides stability by preventing immediate sell-off by allottees. The shares being issued to non-promoters indicates capital infusion from external investors, which could be positive for the company's growth plans. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the increased share capital and new distinguished number ranges.
