## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 6+ million shares represents a material increase in the equity base of Unicommerce eSolutions Limited. However, the immediate market impact is limited by the lock-in period extending until April 14, 2026, preventing these shares from being traded for approximately 6 months post-listing.

**Liquidity Impact**: The locked-in shares will not contribute to tradable float until April 2026. Post lock-in expiry, there may be increased selling pressure if allottees choose to liquidate positions.

**Dilution Impact**: Existing shareholders experience dilution from this preferential allotment. The exact dilution percentage depends on the pre-issue share capital, which is not specified in this circular.

**Investor Considerations**: Non-promoter allottees received shares at Rs. 155.80 per share. Investors should compare this price to current market prices to assess valuation and potential overhang risk post-lock-in expiry.
