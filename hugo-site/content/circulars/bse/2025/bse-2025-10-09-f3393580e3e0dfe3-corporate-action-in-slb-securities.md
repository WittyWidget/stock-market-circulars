## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects liquidity in the SLB segment for four securities during their respective shut periods. Participants with existing positions must plan for foreclosure.

**Operational Impact:** SLB participants need to adjust their lending/borrowing strategies and ensure timely foreclosure of positions. The spin-off actions for Tata Motors and SKF India may have more significant impact on SLB positions compared to routine dividend actions.

**Trading Impact:** No direct impact on regular equity trading. Impact is limited to the Securities Lending and Borrowing segment only.
