---

## Summary

BSE has issued updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective August 11, 2025. The circular details securities being newly included, moved between ASM stages, and removed from the framework. Four new securities are being added to LT-ASM, while six securities are moving out of the framework.

- 1 security moved to higher ASM Stage II (Marg Techno Projects Ltd)
- 2 securities moved to lower ASM Stage II (Ashika Credit Capital Ltd, Vadilal Enterprises Ltd)
- 6 securities moving out of Long Term ASM Framework
- No securities shortlisted for Direct Stage IV Long Term ASM
- Changes effective from August 11, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Securities under LT-ASM framework face enhanced surveillance measures including:
- Increased margin requirements
- Additional disclosure obligations
- Enhanced monitoring of price movements
- Potential trading restrictions based on ASM stage

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must adjust trading strategies for affected securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for securities in ASM framework
- Compliance with additional margin and disclosure requirements
- Monitoring of revised surveillance parameters

## Important Dates

- **August 11, 2025**: Effective date for all LT-ASM framework changes

## Impact Assessment

The changes affect 13 securities across various stages of the ASM framework. Securities moving into higher surveillance stages may experience reduced trading volumes due to stricter requirements. Six securities moving out of the framework will have relaxed trading conditions, potentially improving liquidity. Market participants should adjust risk management strategies accordingly for the affected securities.
