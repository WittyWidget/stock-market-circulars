## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium. The extension affects only shareholders of Ashnisha Industries Limited who are eligible to participate in the Rights Issue.

**Operational Impact:** The 8-day extension provides shareholders with additional time to arrange funds and make informed decisions about participating in the Rights Issue. The extended renunciation period (to November 4, 2025) allows more time for Rights Entitlement trading in the secondary market.

**Investor Impact:** Positive for existing shareholders as it provides more time to evaluate and exercise their rights. The extension may indicate lower-than-expected initial subscription levels, though the company cites providing shareholders with additional opportunity as the reason.

**Timeline Impact:** All subsequent dates in the Rights Issue process (basis of allotment, allotment date, credit date, and listing date) remain aligned with the new closing date, maintaining the overall post-issue timeline structure.
