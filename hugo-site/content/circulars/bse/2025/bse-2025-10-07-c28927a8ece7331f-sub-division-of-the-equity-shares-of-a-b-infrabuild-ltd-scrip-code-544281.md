title: 'Sub-Division of Equity Shares of A B INFRABUILD LTD (Scrip Code: 544281)'
---

## Summary

A B INFRABUILD LTD (Scrip Code: 544281) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share with face value of Rs. 10/- will be subdivided into ten equity shares of Re. 1/- each. The record date for this subdivision is October 17, 2025, and the new share structure will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Company: A B INFRABUILD LTD
- Scrip Code: 544281
- Record Date: October 17, 2025
- Subdivision Ratio: 1:10 (One share of Rs. 10/- into Ten shares of Re. 1/-)
- New Face Value: Re. 1/- per share
- Old Face Value: Rs. 10/- per share
- Effective Date: October 17, 2025
- Notice Number: DR-738/2025-2026
- Current ISIN: INE00YB01017 (will become invalid from October 17, 2025)

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN No. INE00YB01017 for shares with Rs. 10/- face value will not be valid for transactions on the Exchange on or after October 17, 2025. A new ISIN number for Re. 1/- paid-up shares will be issued and communicated to the market through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date of October 17, 2025
- All transactions from October 17, 2025 onwards must use the new ISIN number
- The old ISIN (INE00YB01017) must not be used for transactions on or after the effective date
- Members should await separate notice for the new ISIN number

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 7, 2025
- **Record Date**: October 17, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 17, 2025 (for subdivision and new ISIN)
- **Old ISIN Validity**: Valid until October 16, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The subdivision will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10 times while proportionally reducing the share price. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors. Shareholders' proportional ownership and total investment value remain unchanged.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN and adjusted share structure. The subdivision requires coordination between depository participants, trading systems, and back-office operations to ensure seamless transition on the effective date.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will automatically receive 10 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. No action is required from shareholders. The subdivision is neutral to shareholder value but may enhance trading activity due to lower nominal price per share.
