- Switch processing maintains plan type (Regular to Regular, Direct to Direct)
- Feature limited to lumpsum subscriptions in Non-Demat mode only
- New scheme codes created specifically for NFO Smart Switch transactions
- All purchase orders automatically considered for switch-in to the NFO scheme

## Regulatory Changes

New scheme master entries created:

- SBI Dynamic Asset Allocation Active FOF - NFO Smart Switch - SBI Overnight Fund - Direct Growth

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must use proper scheme credentials for API/bulk upload platforms
- Purchase transactions reported to RTA on transaction day subject to fund confirmation
- Switch transactions reported to RTA on September 04, 2025
- Switch-out processing follows FIFO logic for existing unitholders making additional purchases

## Important Dates

The feature provides convenient switching mechanism during the limited NFO period but requires specific operational procedures and system configurations.
