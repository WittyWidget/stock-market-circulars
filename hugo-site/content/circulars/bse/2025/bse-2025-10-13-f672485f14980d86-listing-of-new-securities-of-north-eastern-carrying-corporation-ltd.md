## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. This is a routine administrative listing of a relatively small number of shares (90,149) resulting from the conversion of partly paid shares to fully paid up status. The conversion represents completion of payment obligations on rights issue shares. The shares carry the same rights as existing equity shares, so there is no dilution effect beyond what was already anticipated when the partly paid shares were originally issued.
