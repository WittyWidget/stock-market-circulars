title: Additional Exposure Margin on Securities under MWPL â€“ October 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular regarding additional exposure margin requirements on securities under the Market-Wide Position Limit (MWPL) framework for October 2025. The circular specifically identifies RBL Bank Limited as a security subject to these enhanced margin requirements.

## Key Points

- Additional exposure margin imposed on RBL Bank Limited (ISIN: INE976G01028, Scrip Code: 540065)
- The measure is part of the MWPL framework implementation
- Applies for the month of October 2025
- Only one security identified in this circular

## Regulatory Changes

The exchange has activated additional exposure margin requirements under the MWPL framework. This is a risk management measure that increases the capital required to hold positions in the identified security.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must collect additional exposure margins from clients on positions in RBL Bank Limited
- Enhanced margin requirements must be applied to both existing and new positions
- Members should ensure adequate risk management systems are in place to monitor and collect the additional margins
- Clients holding positions in the affected security should maintain sufficient funds to meet the increased margin obligations

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: October 17, 2025
- Applicable Period: October 2025

## Impact Assessment

The imposition of additional exposure margins on RBL Bank will increase the cost of carrying positions in this security. Traders and investors with existing positions may face margin calls and need to infuse additional capital. This measure aims to reduce excessive speculation and manage systemic risk in securities that have reached market-wide position limits. The impact is moderate as it affects only one security, but traders active in RBL Bank will experience increased capital requirements for their positions.
