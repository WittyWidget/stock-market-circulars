title: Adoption of Standardised, Validated and Exclusive UPI IDs for Payment Collection
  by SEBI Registered Intermediaries from Investors
---

## Summary

SEBI has introduced a mandatory structured UPI address mechanism for all registered intermediaries to collect payments from investors. The system uses standardized UPI IDs with specific username formats followed by @valid handles linked to self-certified syndicate banks. While usage remains optional for investors, intermediaries must obtain and make these addresses available to their clients.

## Key Points

- Mandatory for all SEBI registered intermediaries to obtain structured UPI addresses
- Username format: intermediary name + segment abbreviation (e.g., abc.brk for broker, xyz.mf for mutual fund)
- Handle format: @valid combined with bank name (e.g., @validhdfc)
- Complete UPI ID example: abc.brk@validhdfc
- Green triangle with thumbs-up icon will identify validated intermediary payments
- Username generation only through SEBI-provided utility
- Optional for investors but intermediaries encouraged to promote adoption

## Regulatory Changes

- Introduction of structured UPI address framework for market intermediaries
- Mandatory compliance for Stock Exchanges, Clearing Corporations, Depositories, RTAs, and SCSBs
- New validation mechanism through SEBI for intermediary bank accounts
- Standardized abbreviation system for different intermediary segments

## Compliance Requirements

- All registered intermediaries must obtain structured UPI addresses
- Must make UPI addresses available to investors
- Active promotion of the mechanism to investors required
- Use only SEBI-approved username generation utility
- Compliance with specific username and handle format requirements
- Coordination with self-certified syndicate banks for handle allocation

## Important Dates

- Circular dated: June 11, 2025
- Implementation timeline and deadlines to be specified in subsequent communications
