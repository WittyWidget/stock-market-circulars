title: Resumption of Subscriptions in Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF Fund of Fund
---

## Summary

Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited has announced the resumption of fresh subscriptions, additional purchases, and switch-in applications for the Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF Fund of Fund effective October 23, 2025. The decision follows changes in market conditions where silver is trading at a discount relative to international prices, causing Silver ETFs to trade at discounts on exchanges. This addendum (No. 45/2025) forms an integral part of the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM).

## Key Points

- Fresh subscriptions and additional purchases in Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF FOF will be accepted from Thursday, October 23, 2025
- Switch-in applications will also be accepted from the effective date
- Decision driven by silver trading at discount relative to international prices
- Silver ETFs currently trading at discounts on exchanges
- Addendum issued on October 20, 2025 from Mumbai
- All other features and terms of SID and KIM remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

This addendum modifies the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) of the Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF Fund of Fund to reflect the resumption of subscriptions. The scheme, which is an open-ended fund of fund investing in units of Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF, had previously restricted fresh subscriptions.

## Compliance Requirements

- The addendum (No. 45/2025) forms an integral part of the SID and KIM and must be read in conjunction with all previous addenda
- Investors must read all scheme-related documents carefully as mutual fund investments are subject to market risks
- Investment Manager: Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Limited (CIN: L65991MH1994PLC080811)

## Important Dates

- **Addendum Date**: October 20, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 23, 2025 (Thursday) - resumption of fresh subscriptions, additional purchases, and switch-in applications

## Impact Assessment

The impact of this circular is limited to investors and potential investors in the Aditya Birla Sun Life Silver ETF Fund of Fund. The resumption of subscriptions provides renewed access to this investment vehicle for those seeking silver exposure through a fund of fund structure. The market condition cited (silver trading at discount to international prices) may present an opportunity for investors, though the standard mutual fund risk disclaimer applies. This is a scheme-specific operational change with no broader market implications.
