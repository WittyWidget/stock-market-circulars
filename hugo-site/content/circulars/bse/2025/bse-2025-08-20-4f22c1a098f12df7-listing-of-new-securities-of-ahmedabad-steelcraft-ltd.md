## Impact Assessment

The listing represents a significant equity dilution of approximately 55.5 lakh shares. The staggered lock-in periods (40 lakh shares until March 2027 and 15.5 lakh shares until March 2026) provide some protection against immediate selling pressure. The preferential allotment to both promoters and non-promoters may impact existing shareholder equity and voting rights.
