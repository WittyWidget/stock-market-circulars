## Key Points

- Total shares being listed: 3,35,590
- All shares have lock-in expiry date of August 21, 2025
- Shares issued under ESOP/ESOS arrangements
- Distinguished Security Numbers (DST) assigned for each batch of shares
- Multiple tranches with varying quantities from 1,000 to 1,00,000 shares

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must ensure proper documentation for ESOP/ESOS share issuance
- Lock-in period compliance until August 21, 2025
- Proper assignment and tracking of Distinguished Security Numbers

## Important Dates

- **Lock-in Expiry Date**: August 21, 2025 (for all listed shares)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine administrative listing with minimal market impact. The lock-in period ensures these shares cannot be traded until August 21, 2025, preventing immediate dilution effects. The listing provides transparency for ESOP/ESOS beneficiaries and maintains proper regulatory compliance for employee stock option programs.
