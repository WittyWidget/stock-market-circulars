## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing of 1.29 crore shares represents significant equity dilution for existing shareholders. The preferential allotment at Rs. 121/- per share will increase the company's equity base and provide capital for growth initiatives. The staggered lock-in periods (with approximately 77% of shares locked until April 2026 and 23% until April 2027) will limit immediate selling pressure.

**Liquidity Impact**: Medium-term impact on stock liquidity as locked-in shares cannot be traded until respective lock-in expiry dates. Post lock-in, increased float may enhance liquidity.

**Investor Consideration**: Existing shareholders should assess the dilution impact on their holdings and the intended use of proceeds from warrant conversion. The preferential allotment to both promoters and non-promoters indicates mixed shareholding pattern changes.
