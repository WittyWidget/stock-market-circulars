## Summary

BSE has issued a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for trading members to file review, appeal or waiver requests against penalties and actions taken by the Exchange or Member Committee. This follows SEBI circular SEBI/HO/MRD/POD-III/CIR/P/2025/112 dated August 5, 2025. The procedure establishes a two-tier review mechanism with specific timelines and processing fees.

## Key Points

- Trading members can appeal actions taken by the Exchange before the Member Committee
- Actions decided by Member Committee can be appealed before a Review Committee comprising Public Interest Directors and Independent External Persons
- Appeals must be filed within 45 days of receiving the aggrieved decision, with possible 15-day extension for valid reasons
- Non-refundable processing fee of ₹10,000 plus applicable taxes required
- Applications must be submitted to designated email xyz@bseindia.com or through portal
- No appeals entertained after 60 days from receipt of decision
- Incomplete applications without payment proof or requisite documents will be closed

## Regulatory Changes

- New two-tier appeal mechanism introduced:
  - **First Forum**: Member Committee (for Exchange actions) or Review Committee (for Member Committee decisions)
  - **Second Forum**: Courts/Tribunals as per applicable laws
- Review Committee composition: Public Interest Directors (excluding MC members) and/or Independent External Persons
- Processing fees jointly decided by stock exchanges and subject to periodic revision
- No processing fees for suo-motu reviews initiated by Exchange

## Compliance Requirements

- **Submission**: File written request to xyz@bseindia.com or through portal with all supporting documents
- **Timeline**: Within 45 days of receiving aggrieved decision (extensible by 15 days with valid reasons)
- **Payment**: Pay non-refundable processing fee of ₹10,000 + applicable taxes and provide proof
- **Documentation**: Submit complete application with all requisite documents and information
- **Completeness**: Exchange will verify completeness before forwarding to concerned authority
- **Absolute Deadline**: No appeals accepted after 60 days from receipt of decision

## Important Dates

- **September 19, 2025**: Review Committee mechanism effective date
- **August 5, 2025**: Reference SEBI circular date (SEBI/HO/MRD/POD-III/CIR/P/2025/112)
- **August 8, 2025**: Prior Exchange Notice No. 20250808-26 date
- **Filing Deadline**: 45 days from receipt of aggrieved decision (primary)
- **Extended Deadline**: Additional 15 days with sufficient reasons (maximum 60 days total)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Establishes clear procedural framework for trading members to contest regulatory actions, providing structured grievance redressal mechanism. The two-tier system ensures independent review of Member Committee decisions.

**Member Impact**: Provides trading members with formal avenue to challenge penalties and actions with defined timelines and reasonable processing fees. The 45+15 day window balances timely resolution with member rights.

**Transparency Impact**: Standardizes appeal process with clear documentation requirements, designated communication channels, and defined authority levels, enhancing regulatory transparency and accountability.
