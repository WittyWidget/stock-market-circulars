## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to note the new securities for trading purposes
- Companies have completed their listing formalities with BSE
- All shares meet BSE listing requirements with no lock-in restrictions

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 20, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date:** October 21, 2025 (Tuesday)
- **Lock-in Expiry:** Not Applicable (NA) - no lock-in period for any shares

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - The issuance represents routine ESOP/ESOS share listings with relatively small quantities compared to the existing equity base of most companies. The largest single issuance is 429,000 shares by Sai Life Sciences Limited.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal incremental impact on float for most companies. Banking sector companies (AXIS Bank, ICICI Bank, AU Small Finance Bank) show larger absolute numbers but these represent a fraction of their existing share capital.

**Dilution Impact:** Negligible dilution for existing shareholders given the small proportion of new shares relative to existing equity base.

**Investor Consideration:** These shares are freely tradable from day one with no lock-in restrictions, allowing employee option holders to liquidate positions immediately if desired.
