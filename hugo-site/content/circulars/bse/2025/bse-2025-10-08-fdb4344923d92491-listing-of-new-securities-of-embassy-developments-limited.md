## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action involving preferential allotment to promoters through warrant conversion. The lock-in period ensures shares cannot be traded until April 8, 2025 (as stated in the circular). The listing increases the company's paid-up equity capital and provides additional funds from promoter subscription. Market impact is minimal as these shares are locked-in and represent a standard capital raising mechanism through preferential route.
