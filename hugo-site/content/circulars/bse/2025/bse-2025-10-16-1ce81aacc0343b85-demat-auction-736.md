**Market Impact:** Medium - Affects trading members who failed to deliver securities in the regular settlement cycle. The auction helps maintain market integrity by ensuring delivery obligations are fulfilled.

**Operational Impact:** Directly impacts brokers and trading members with open delivery positions in the listed scrips. Members need to either participate in auction or face penalty/close-out consequences.

**Investor Impact:** Limited direct impact on retail investors unless they are buyers/sellers in the affected settlements. May cause temporary price volatility in thinly traded scrips during auction.

**Notable Holdings:** Significant quantities include Reliance Power (6,700 shares), Motherson Sumi (6,797 shares), NIPPON LIFE (14,613 shares), Nippon India (4,408 shares), PTC India Financial (4,301 shares), indicating substantial delivery failures in these securities.
