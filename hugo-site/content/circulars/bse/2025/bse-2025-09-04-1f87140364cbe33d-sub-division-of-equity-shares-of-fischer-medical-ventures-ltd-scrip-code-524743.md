title: 'Sub-Division of Equity Shares of Fischer Medical Ventures Ltd (Scrip Code:
  524743)'
---

## Summary

Fischer Medical Ventures Ltd (Scrip Code: 524743) has announced a stock subdivision where each existing equity share of Rs. 10 will be split into ten equity shares of Re. 1 each. The record date for this subdivision is September 12, 2025, and the new share structure will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Stock split ratio: 1:10 (one Rs. 10 share becomes ten Re. 1 shares)
- Record date: September 12, 2025
- Effective date: September 12, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE771F01025) for Rs. 10 shares will become invalid from September 12, 2025
- New ISIN for Re. 1 shares to be announced separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE771F01025 for Rs. 10 paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions from September 12, 2025 onwards. A new ISIN number for Re. 1 paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date of September 12, 2025
- All transactions involving the old ISIN must be completed before September 12, 2025
- Members should await the new ISIN notification for Re. 1 shares

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: September 12, 2025
- **Effective Date**: September 12, 2025
- **ISIN Validity Cutoff**: September 12, 2025 (old ISIN becomes invalid)

## Impact Assessment

The stock subdivision will increase the number of shares outstanding by 10 times while proportionally reducing the share price. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more affordable for retail investors. The change in ISIN requires system updates and careful handling of transactions during the transition period.
