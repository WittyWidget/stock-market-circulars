## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects shareholders of Capital Trust Limited who hold rights entitlements and wish to either exercise their rights, trade them, or renounce them during the specified period.

**Operational Impact**: Trading Members must ensure proper client communication, including appropriate disclaimers in contract notes and clear explanation of RE mechanics. The trade-for-trade settlement on T+1 basis requires specific operational handling compared to regular equity trading.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders must act within the specified timeframe to either subscribe to the rights issue, trade their entitlements, or renounce them. Failure to act will result in lapse of entitlements after the issue closing date.
