## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine operational circular for G-sec auction participation. The non-competitive bidding facility has been operational since 2018.

**Operational Impact:** Low - Standard auction process with established procedures. Trading members familiar with the NCB-GSec module can participate without additional system changes.

**Investor Impact:** Low - Provides retail and institutional investors access to government securities through a transparent auction mechanism with capped maximum investment of Rs. 2 crores per security.

**Securities Details:**
1. **6.01% GS 2030** (Symbol: 601GS30O25) - 5-year maturity, Rs. 18,000 crore issuance
2. **7.09% GS 2074** (Symbol: 709GS74O25) - Long-term 49-year maturity, Rs. 12,000 crore issuance

The longer-dated security offers higher yield reflecting the extended maturity period and interest rate risk premium.
