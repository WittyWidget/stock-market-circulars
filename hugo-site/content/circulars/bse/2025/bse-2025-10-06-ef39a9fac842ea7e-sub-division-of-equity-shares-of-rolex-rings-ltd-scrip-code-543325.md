Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs.10 will be split into ten equity shares with a face value of Re.1 each. The record date for this corporate action is October 17, 2025, and the new face value becomes effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares (stock split)
- Split Ratio: 1:10 (one share of Rs.10 becomes ten shares of Re.1)

- Record Date: October 17, 2025
- Effective Date: October 17, 2025

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date of October 17, 2025
- All transactions on or after October 17, 2025 must use the new ISIN (to be announced)
- The old ISIN INE645S01016 will not be valid for exchange transactions from October 17, 2025 onwards
- Market participants should await separate notice for the new ISIN number
- Demat accounts will be automatically adjusted to reflect the new quantity and face value

## Important Dates

- **October 6, 2025**: Circular announcement date
- **October 17, 2025**: Record date for sub-division
- **October 17, 2025**: Effective date for new face value (Re.1)
- **October 17, 2025**: Old ISIN becomes invalid for exchange transactions

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held. The total value of holdings remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases proportionately.

**Market Impact**: Stock splits typically improve liquidity by reducing the per-share price, making shares more accessible to retail investors. The 1:10 split will reduce the trading price to approximately one-tenth of the current level.

**Trading Impact**: A new ISIN will be assigned, requiring system updates by brokers, depositories, and market infrastructure. No trading disruption is expected as this is a standard corporate action.

**Operational Impact**: Depositories (NSDL/CDSL) will automatically credit additional shares to demat accounts based on holdings as of the record date. No action required from shareholders.
