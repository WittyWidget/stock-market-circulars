- Issue price: Rs. 310/- per unit
- Scrip Code: 543261
- ISIN: INE0FDU25010

- Units rank pari-passu with existing units

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date**: September 2, 2025
- **Trading Commencement**: September 5, 2025
- **Lock-in Period Expires**: September 6, 2026

## Impact Assessment

The listing increases the tradeable float of BIRET units on BSE. The lock-in period until September 2026 means these units cannot be traded immediately by allottees, providing stability to the unit price. The preferential allotment suggests strategic investment or expansion funding for the REIT.
