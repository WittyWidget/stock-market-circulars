title: Addition of Aditya Birla Sun Life Sampoorna Systematic Investment Plan (SIP)
  facility on BSE StAR MF platform
---

## Summary

BSE has introduced the Sampoorna Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) facility for Aditya Birla Sun Life schemes on the BSE StAR MF platform. This facility allows MFIs/MFDs/RIAs to register Sampoorna Systematic Registrations for clients in Non-Demat mode only for specified schemes, with mandatory Target Scheme and Target Amount requirements.

## Key Points

- Sampoorna Systematic Registrations available only in Non-Demat mode for certain AMC-specified schemes
- Available for SIP/XSIP/ISIP registrations through manual entry only
- Dropdown menu allows selection between Regular or Sampoorna Systematic Registrations
- Target Scheme and Target Amount are mandatory fields for Sampoorna registrations
- New reporting features with specific identification in Exchange Remarks column

## Regulatory Changes

- Introduction of new Sampoorna SIP registration category on BSE StAR MF platform
- Enhanced registration process with additional mandatory fields for target scheme and amount
- Modified reporting structure to identify Sampoorna registrations

## Compliance Requirements

- MFIs/MFDs/RIAs must use manual entry for Sampoorna Systematic Registrations
- Must specify Target Scheme and Target Amount when opting for Sampoorna registrations
- Must access specific menu paths for SIP and XSIP registrations
- Must use designated report paths for tracking Sampoorna registrations

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: August 1, 2025 (circular date)

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on mutual fund intermediaries using BSE StAR MF platform. The new facility provides enhanced SIP options for Aditya Birla Sun Life schemes but requires operational adjustments for manual registration processes. All existing procedures and validations remain unchanged except for the new Sampoorna-specific requirements.
