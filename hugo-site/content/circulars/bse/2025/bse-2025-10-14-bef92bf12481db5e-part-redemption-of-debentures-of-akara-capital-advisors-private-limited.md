**Market Operations**: Trading members need to adjust their systems to accommodate the new face value from October 16, 2025. The settlement process will reflect the reduced face value for all trades executed on or after the effective date.

**Liquidity**: The part redemption may impact liquidity in these debentures as the outstanding amount is reduced. Secondary market activity may be limited to smaller position sizes post-redemption.

**Issuer**: AKARA CAPITAL ADVISORS PRIVATE LIMITED is fulfilling its debt obligations through this scheduled part redemption, which is a positive indicator of financial management and commitment to debt servicing.
