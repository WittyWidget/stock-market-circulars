## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The preferential allotment increases the paid-up capital of Adani Green Energy Limited by approximately 1.27% (assuming current base). The shares are locked-in until April 2027, so no immediate impact on free float or trading liquidity.

**Promoter Holdings:** The allotment to promoters will increase promoter holding percentage, strengthening their stake in the company.

**Price Impact:** Minimal immediate impact as shares are locked-in and this was a known corporate action from warrant conversion approved earlier.

**Investor Consideration:** Investors should factor in the dilution from warrant conversion and monitor promoter holding levels post this allotment.
