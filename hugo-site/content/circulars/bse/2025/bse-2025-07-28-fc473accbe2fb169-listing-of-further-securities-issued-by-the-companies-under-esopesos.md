## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected as these are routine ESOP/ESOS share listings. The additional shares represent employee compensation conversions and are typically absorbed by the market without significant price volatility. Marico's large allocation of 1.8 million shares may have slight dilutive effect but is standard for large-scale employee option exercises.
