## Summary

BSE has issued a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document to assist stock brokers in filling out the Risk Based Supervision (RBS) submission form for the period April 01, 2025 to September 30, 2025. The FAQ provides detailed instructions on completing various fields including loans to associate/group companies, insurance details, brokerage income, client debit balances, collateral valuation, delayed payment charges, fraud instances, SEBI inspections, and disciplinary actions.

## Key Points

- Field G (Loans to Associates): If no loans given to associate/group companies, insert "0" in secured and unsecured loans, insert "N.A./Not Applicable" in loan details, then click add button
- Field F (Insurance Details): Click add button after entering data to save records
- Field 20 (Brokerage Income): Consider gross brokerage revenue from broking operations across all exchanges
- Field 22 (Client Debit Balances): Report aggregate value of clear debit balances across MTF/Non-MTF balances after adjusting for open bills, uncleared cheques, and margin obligations
- Field 23 (Collateral Valuation): Use T day quantity and T-1 day closing price reduced by appropriate haircut (not less than VAR margin rate). Consider collateral in Pool Account and pledged accounts (Client Securities Margin Pledge Account, Client Securities Under Margin Funding Account, Client Unpaid Securities Pledgee Account)
- Field 24 (Delayed Payment Charges): Report total late/delayed payment charges collected from clients during year ended March 31, 2024 across all exchanges
- Field L (PAN Details): Entities where PAN is not applicable should use "PANNOTAPPL" with mandatory reasons specified
- For zero instances (fraud, SEBI inspections, disciplinary actions), insert "0" and save data
