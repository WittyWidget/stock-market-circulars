## Impact Assessment

This circular facilitates retail and institutional participation in government securities auction through non-competitive bidding. The Rs. 32,000 crore auction size is substantial and provides investment opportunities in government securities across different maturity profiles (3-year to 30-year tenors). Impact is limited to debt market participants and does not directly affect equity markets. The facility enables price discovery and liquidity in the government securities market.
