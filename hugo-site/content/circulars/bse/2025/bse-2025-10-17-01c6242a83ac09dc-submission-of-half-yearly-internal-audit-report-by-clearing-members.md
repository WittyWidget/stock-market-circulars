title: Submission of Half Yearly Internal Audit Report by Clearing Members
---

## Summary

BSE requires clearing members to submit half-yearly internal audit reports verifying compliance with margin collection requirements, client fund segregation rules, and regulatory obligations. The audit covers critical areas including consolidated crystallized obligation margins, segregation of client funds and securities, prohibition on cash dealings, and restrictions on pledging client securities.

## Key Points

- Clearing members must conduct internal audits covering the half-year period
- Audit must verify margin collection on Consolidated Crystallized Obligation in cash only (not FDRs/BGs) for F&O and Currency segments
- Verification required for EOD margins and peak margins collected from trading members/custodial participants
- Auditors must confirm margin collection reported to Clearing Corporation matches actual collections
- Client funds and securities must be segregated from proprietary accounts
- Zero cash dealings permitted with trading members/custodial participants
- Members prohibited from pledging client securities to banks/NBFCs even with client authorization
- Daily Margin Statements (DMS) must be issued to clients with proof of delivery maintained

## Regulatory Changes

The circular reinforces existing regulations including:
- Circular 20200710-45 regarding cash-only margin collection for Consolidated Crystallized Obligation
- Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957 - Rule 8(1)(f) & 8(3)(f) prohibiting fund-based activities
- Circulars 20220107-45 and 20220922-49 regarding borrowed/loaned monies
