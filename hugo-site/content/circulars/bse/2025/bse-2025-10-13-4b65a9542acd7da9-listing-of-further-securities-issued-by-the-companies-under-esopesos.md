These newly issued shares will be available for trading effective Tuesday, October 14, 2025. None of the listed shares are subject to lock-in restrictions.

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed of the new securities listing
- Companies must ensure proper disclosure and listing procedures are completed
- Standard trading rules and regulations apply to these securities from the effective date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 13, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** October 14, 2025 (Tuesday)
- **Lock-in Expiry:** Not applicable (NA for all securities)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal to low. ESOP/ESOS issuances are routine corporate actions that typically represent small percentages of companies' total outstanding shares. The listing enables employees who exercised their stock options to trade these shares in the open market.

**Liquidity Impact:** Marginal increase in tradable float for the 18 companies. The largest issuances are Premier Energies (2.22 million shares), L&T Finance (1.31 million shares), and DigiSpice Technologies (625,000 shares).

**Investor Consideration:** These listings may result in minor selling pressure if employees choose to liquidate their holdings, though this is typically absorbed by normal market volumes for established companies.
