**Market Impact**: Medium - The share sub-division and ISIN change affects trading and settlement processes for this specific security. Trading members and market infrastructure providers need to update their systems before the ex-date.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure timely system updates to accommodate the new ISIN. Failure to update systems may result in trade rejections or settlement issues. Shareholders will receive shares with new face value and ISIN, but their total investment value remains unchanged.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will see their shareholding quantity increase proportionally (5:1 ratio) while the face value per share decreases from Rs.10 to Rs.2. Market price will adjust accordingly on the ex-date.
