## Lock-in Details

| Number of Shares | Distribution Numbers | Lock-in Period Until |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 11,80,000 | 5002601 - 6182600 | April 30, 2026 |
| 80,000 | 6182601 - 6262600 | April 29, 2026 |

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of preferentially allotted shares representing a capital raise for the company. The lock-in periods (until April 2026) mean these shares cannot be immediately sold in the market, limiting immediate supply-side pressure.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders should note the dilution from the new share issuance. The preferential allotment to non-promoters at Rs. 22 per share indicates the pricing basis for this capital raise.

**Trading Impact**: Minimal immediate trading impact expected due to lock-in restrictions on all newly listed shares. Full trading liquidity for these shares will only be available post-April 2026.
