## Summary

Tourism Finance Corporation of India Ltd (Scrip Code: 526650) has announced the subdivision of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of Rs. 10/- face value will be subdivided into five equity shares of Rs. 2/- face value each, effective September 19, 2025.

- Record date: September 19, 2025
- Effective date: September 19, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE305A01015) will become invalid from September 19, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs. 2/- shares to be notified separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE305A01015 for Rs. 10/- paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after September 19, 2025. A new ISIN number for the Rs. 2/- paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the change in share structure
- Transactions in the old ISIN will not be permitted from September 19, 2025
