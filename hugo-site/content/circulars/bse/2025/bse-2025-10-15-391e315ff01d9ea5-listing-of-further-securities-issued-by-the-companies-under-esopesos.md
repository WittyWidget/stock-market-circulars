## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The listing of ESOP shares is a routine corporate action that increases the outstanding share count marginally for each company. The dilution effect is generally small and already anticipated by the market as part of employee compensation practices.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible immediate impact on liquidity. ESOP shares typically have lock-in periods (though most in this notice have none), and employees may not immediately sell their holdings.

**Company-Specific Impact:**
- ICICI Bank: 519,159 shares represent minimal dilution given its large outstanding share base
- Unicommerce eSolutions: 2,065,664 shares (largest issuance) may have slightly higher dilution impact for this relatively newer listing
- Other companies: Share issuances range from 2,200 to 260,748 shares, representing routine ESOP grants

**Operational Impact:** None. Trading members can begin trading these securities from October 16, 2025, through normal trading systems without any special procedures.
