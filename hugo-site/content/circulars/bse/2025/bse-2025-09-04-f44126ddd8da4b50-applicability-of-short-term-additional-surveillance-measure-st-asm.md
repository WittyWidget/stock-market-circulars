## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective September 5, 2025. Thirteen securities are being shortlisted into the ST-ASM framework, one security is moving to a higher stage, and five securities are moving out of the framework.

## Key Points

- 13 securities newly shortlisted in Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework
- 1 security (Cropster Agro Ltd) moving to higher stage ASM
- 5 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework
- Changes effective from September 5, 2025
- Framework includes various surveillance stages and restrictions

## Regulatory Changes

Securities entering ST-ASM framework will be subject to additional surveillance measures including potential restrictions on trading frequency and enhanced monitoring. Securities moving out may transition to other surveillance frameworks like LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, ESM, or Pledge Framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of surveillance status changes
- Trading in affected securities subject to ASM framework rules
- Compliance with enhanced monitoring and reporting requirements
- Adherence to stage-specific trading restrictions

## Important Dates

- **September 5, 2025**: Effective date for all ST-ASM framework changes

## Impact Assessment

The surveillance measures will impact trading liquidity and investor behavior for the affected securities. Securities entering the framework may experience reduced trading volumes due to additional restrictions, while those exiting may see normalized trading patterns depending on their new classification.
