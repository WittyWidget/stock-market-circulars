## Summary

BSE has issued surveillance measures for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) effective August 12, 2025. The circular includes stage transitions for companies in insolvency resolution processes and provides a consolidated list of all securities currently under various IBC surveillance stages.

## Key Points

- No securities moved to Stage 0, Stage II, or were excluded from surveillance
- Consolidated list includes 13+ securities across different IBC surveillance stages
- T+0 scrips are specifically marked with ~ symbol when shortlisted under parent company IBC framework

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of staged surveillance approach for IBC companies
- Stage 0: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from company
- Stage 1: Additional Surveillance Measure for companies in Insolvency Resolution Process
- Stage 2: Enhanced surveillance measures (higher stage)

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies under IBC surveillance must comply with enhanced disclosure requirements
- Trading restrictions may apply based on surveillance stage
- Investors should be aware of heightened risks associated with securities under IBC proceedings

## Important Dates

- **Market Monitoring**: BSE will maintain closer oversight of price movements and trading patterns in affected securities
- **Liquidity Considerations**: Some securities may experience reduced liquidity due to surveillance measures
