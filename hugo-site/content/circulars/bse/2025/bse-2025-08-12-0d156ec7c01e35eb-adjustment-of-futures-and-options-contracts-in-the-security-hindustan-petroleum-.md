---

## Summary

BSE will adjust all Futures and Options contracts for Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) on August 13, 2025, due to a final dividend of Rs. 10.50 per share with record date August 14, 2025. The adjustments will be effective from August 14, 2025.

## Key Points

- HPCL has declared final dividend of Rs. 10.50 per equity share for FY 2025-26
- Record date: August 14, 2025
- Ex-date: August 14, 2025
- Adjustment date: August 13, 2025
- All existing F&O contracts on HPCL will be adjusted

## Regulatory Changes

Adjustments made in accordance with:
- Exchange notice number 20180710-26 regarding corporate action adjustments for stock options
- SEBI Master circular No SEBI/HO/MRD/DP/CIR/P/2016/135 dated December 16, 2016

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the adjusted strike prices and futures prices
- Members should contact relationship managers for further clarification
- Adjustments will be automatically applied by the exchange

## Important Dates

- **August 13, 2025**: Adjustment implementation date
- **August 14, 2025**: Ex-dividend date and record date
- **August 14, 2025**: Adjusted contracts available for trading

## Impact Assessment

**Options Contracts**: All strike prices will be reduced by Rs. 10.50, with adjusted strikes available from August 14, 2025.

**Futures Contracts**: Adjusted futures price = Reference rate (daily mark-to-market settlement price on August 13) minus Rs. 10.50. This adjusted rate becomes the base rate for trading from August 14, 2025.

Impact is routine for dividend adjustments but affects all HPCL derivative positions and pricing.
