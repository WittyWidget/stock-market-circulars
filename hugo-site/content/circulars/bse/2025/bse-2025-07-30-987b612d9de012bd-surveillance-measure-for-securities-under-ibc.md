title: Surveillance Measure for Securities Under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC)
---

## Summary

BSE has updated its surveillance measures for securities under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) framework. Diksha Greens Ltd (Scrip Code: 542155, ISIN: INE01GR01018) has been added to Stage 0 surveillance for receipt of corporate announcements effective July 31, 2025. The circular provides consolidated lists of securities under various IBC surveillance stages.

## Key Points

- Diksha Greens Ltd added to Stage 0 IBC surveillance (corporate announcement stage)
- No securities moved between IBC surveillance stages
- No securities excluded from IBC surveillance measures
- Consolidated list maintains 14+ companies across different IBC stages
- Framework includes multi-stage surveillance (Stage 0, Stage I, Stage II)

## Regulatory Changes

No changes to the IBC surveillance framework structure. The update represents routine application of existing surveillance measures to newly identified securities requiring monitoring under insolvency proceedings.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies under IBC surveillance must comply with enhanced disclosure requirements
- Trading members should note surveillance status when executing trades
- Corporate announcements from Stage 0 companies require careful monitoring
- T+0 scrips under parent company IBC framework have special marking requirements

## Important Dates

- **July 31, 2025**: Effective date for Diksha Greens Ltd inclusion in Stage 0 surveillance
- **July 31, 2025**: Effective date for all surveillance stage transitions (none in this update)

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as only one security added to surveillance. The IBC surveillance framework continues to provide structured monitoring of companies under insolvency proceedings. Existing framework maintains oversight of companies across different stages of insolvency resolution process, ensuring market participants have appropriate visibility into companies' financial distress status.
