## Regulatory Framework

The GSM framework applies progressive surveillance measures based on security performance and market behavior. Higher stages involve stricter trading conditions and enhanced monitoring.

## Impact Assessment

Securities in higher GSM stages face increased trading restrictions, reduced liquidity, and enhanced regulatory scrutiny. Investors should exercise caution when trading these securities due to heightened surveillance measures.
