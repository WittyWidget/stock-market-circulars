## Impact Assessment

This preferential allotment represents a significant capital raising exercise by Poonawalla Fincorp, with promoters subscribing to shares at Rs. 452.51 per share. The 18-month lock-in period ensures promoter commitment and prevents immediate dilution pressure on existing shareholders. The allotment of over 3.31 crore shares will increase the company's equity base and may impact shareholding patterns and EPS calculations. Market impact is moderate as these shares cannot be traded until April 2027.
