title: Applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM)
---

## Summary

BSE has issued an update on the applicability of Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective October 10, 2025. Three securities are being newly shortlisted under LT-ASM, while one security (Mcleod Russel India Ltd) is being moved out of the framework due to inclusion in ESM Framework. No securities are being moved to higher or lower ASM stages, and no securities are being placed directly in Stage IV.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities added to Long Term ASM Framework: Epuja Spiritech Ltd, Gayatri Sugars Ltd, and Vuenow Infratech Ltd
- 1 security removed from LT-ASM: Mcleod Russel India Ltd (moved to ESM Framework)
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages
- No securities being placed directly in Stage IV of LT-ASM
- Consolidated list includes 15+ securities continuing under various ASM stages
- Changes effective from October 10, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The LT-ASM framework is part of BSE's surveillance measures to monitor securities exhibiting unusual price movements or volatility patterns. Securities under this framework are subject to additional trading restrictions and monitoring to protect investor interests and maintain market integrity.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of securities under LT-ASM framework
- Trading members should inform clients about enhanced surveillance status
- Securities under LT-ASM may have specific trading conditions or margin requirements
- Continuous monitoring required for securities listed in the consolidated list

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 10, 2025 - LT-ASM changes become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Securities Added to LT-ASM:**
- Epuja Spiritech Ltd (Scrip Code: 532092, ISIN: INE807D01030)
- Gayatri Sugars Ltd (Scrip Code: 532183, ISIN: INE622E01023)
- Vuenow Infratech Ltd (Scrip Code: 531997, ISIN: INE164D01010)

**Securities Removed from LT-ASM:**
- Mcleod Russel India Ltd (Scrip Code: 532654, ISIN: INE942G01012) - moved to ESM Framework

The addition of securities to LT-ASM indicates heightened regulatory scrutiny and may result in reduced liquidity and increased margin requirements for these stocks. Investors holding these securities should be aware of the enhanced surveillance status. The removal of Mcleod Russel India Ltd from LT-ASM to ESM Framework indicates a change in surveillance classification rather than an improvement in trading status.
