- Total shares under lock-in: Approximately 5.94 crore shares
- Public IPO shares (1.27 crore): Not under lock-in
- Multiple lock-in categories with different expiry dates
- All shares are in demat form
- Lock-in effective from July 30, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing circular providing lock-in details as per existing SEBI regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Locked-in shareholders cannot trade their shares until respective lock-in periods expire
- Company and depositories must ensure lock-in restrictions are properly implemented
- Shareholders must comply with lock-in provisions as specified

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on Shanti Gold International Limited shareholders. The lock-in arrangements will restrict trading liquidity for approximately 82% of total shares for varying periods. Short-term restrictions affect smaller tranches while majority of promoter/pre-IPO shares remain locked for 1-3 years, which is standard for newly listed companies.
