title: Trading and Settlement of Trades in Dematerialised Securities of Devinsu Trading
  Ltd
---

## Summary

BSE has announced that Devinsu Trading Ltd (scrip code: 512445) has successfully signed agreements with both depositories (NSDL and CDSL). Effective from settlement number DR-743/2025-2026 beginning Monday, October 27, 2025, the scrip will undergo significant changes in trading and settlement parameters including group migration from P to XT, market lot reduction from 100 to 1 share, and mandatory demat settlement under trade-to-trade segment.

## Key Points

- Scrip will be traded in Trade-to-Trade (T2T) segment for reasons other than non-signing of depository agreements
- All trades must be settled in compulsory dematerialised form
- Market lot reduced from 100 equity shares to 1 equity share
- Netting will not be allowed in the scrip
- Shortages will be directly closed out
- ISIN remains unchanged: INE07LH01016
- Group migration from P to XT

## Regulatory Changes

The scrip transitions from Group P to Group XT, indicating a change in trading restrictions. Despite being in trade-to-trade segment typically associated with depository non-compliance, this placement is for other operational reasons. The mandatory demat settlement requirement aligns with SEBI's push for dematerialization of securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all client trades in Devinsu Trading Ltd are settled only in dematerialised form
- No physical settlement will be permitted
- Members must account for the new market lot of 1 share when accepting client orders
- Position netting is prohibited; each trade must be settled independently
- Members must be prepared for direct close-out of any shortages without auction or other remedial mechanisms

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 24, 2025
- **Effective Date**: Monday, October 27, 2025
- **Settlement Number**: DR-743/2025-2026 onwards

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: Trading members will need to update their systems to reflect the new market lot of 1 share and the group change to XT. The prohibition on netting may increase settlement obligations and margin requirements for members with multiple client positions.

**Market Impact**: The move to trade-to-trade segment with compulsory demat settlement may impact liquidity as intraday trading opportunities are eliminated. However, the signing of depository agreements is a positive development that enables dematerialized trading and settlement, improving investor protection and settlement efficiency.

**Investor Impact**: Retail investors benefit from the reduced market lot (from 100 to 1 share), lowering the minimum investment requirement and improving accessibility. All investors must ensure they have demat accounts as physical settlement is no longer available.
