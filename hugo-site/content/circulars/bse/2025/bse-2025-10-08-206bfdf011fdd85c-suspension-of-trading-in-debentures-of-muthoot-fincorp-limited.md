## Key Points

- No dealings permitted from: October 13, 2025
- Reference: DR-734/2025-2026
- Trading members must take note and comply with suspension

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is a standard operational suspension pursuant to redemption procedures for non-convertible debentures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from October 13, 2025
- Members must inform their clients holding these debentures about the trading suspension
- All outstanding orders for these securities should be cancelled before the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **Record Date:** October 13, 2025
- **Trading Suspension Effective From:** October 13, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low to medium - affects only holders and potential traders of these two specific NCD series. The suspension is temporary and linked to the redemption process.

**Investor Impact:** Medium - debenture holders will not be able to trade these securities from the suspension date, but this is expected as part of the redemption process. Investors on record as of October 13, 2025 will receive redemption proceeds.

**Operational Impact:** Low - routine suspension procedure that exchanges and brokers regularly handle for maturing debt instruments.
