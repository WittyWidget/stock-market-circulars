## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders of Modern Insulators Ltd will receive shares in Modern Polytex Limited in the ratio of 1:2, effectively creating two separate holdings. This represents a significant restructuring of shareholder portfolios and may affect investment strategies.

**Trading Impact**: The transfer to 'XT' group and Special Pre-open Session indicates heightened surveillance and controlled trading environment on the record date. This may result in price discovery through call auction mechanism and potentially higher volatility.

**Market Structure**: The demerger separates the Yarn Division business into a standalone listed entity (Modern Polytex Limited), allowing for focused operations and separate market valuations for each business vertical. This corporate restructuring enables shareholders to independently assess and trade positions in the insulator and yarn businesses.

**Operational Impact**: The demerger allows both entities to pursue independent growth strategies with dedicated management focus on their respective core businesses - insulators for Modern Insulators and yarn manufacturing for Modern Polytex.
