## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine listing of privately placed debt securities that adds to the debt market inventory. The securities are institutional in nature with high face value (Rs. 1 lakh per debenture) and will have limited retail participation.

**Issuer Profile**: Adani Transmission Step-Two Limited is part of the Adani Group, engaged in power transmission business. The AA+ credit rating indicates strong creditworthiness.

**Investor Impact**: Relevant for debt investors seeking exposure to infrastructure sector bonds with quarterly interest payments. The securities offer a maturity ladder from short-term (1.2 years) to long-term (17 years), providing options for different investment horizons.

**Liquidity**: Expected liquidity may be limited given the private placement nature and institutional ticket size. Market lot of 1 provides some flexibility for trading.
