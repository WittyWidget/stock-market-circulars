## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing notification with limited market impact. The preferential allotment represents a relatively small issuance to non-promoters through warrant conversion. The lock-in period until March 31, 2026, means these shares will not be available for trading until that date, preventing immediate supply pressure. The listing enables the company to expand its equity base while maintaining stability through the lock-in mechanism. Impact is limited to Advait Energy Transitions Limited shareholders and potential investors.
