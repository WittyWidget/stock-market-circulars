## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a standard listing notification for securities issued pursuant to warrant conversion under SEBI regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed about the new securities available for trading
- Lock-in restrictions must be observed by all market participants
- Distinct number ranges specified for tracking locked-in shares

## Important Dates

- **Allotment Date (Tranche 1):** September 17, 2025 (2,25,00,000 shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium. The listing adds 4.5 crore equity shares to the company's equity base, representing significant dilution for existing shareholders. However, since all shares are locked-in until April 2027, there will be no immediate selling pressure or impact on free float.

**Liquidity Impact:** Minimal immediate impact as locked-in shares cannot be traded until lock-in expiry.

**Shareholding Impact:** Promoter holding will increase as these shares were allotted to promoters on preferential basis, potentially strengthening promoter stake and control.

**Operational Impact:** The preferential allotment at Rs. 90.30 per share infuses capital into the company (approximately Rs. 406.35 crores), which may be used for business expansion, debt reduction, or working capital purposes.
