## Impact Assessment

This demat auction affects trading members who failed to deliver securities on the settlement date. The auction mechanism ensures market integrity by forcing delivery of securities or cash settlement at auction prices. Impact is primarily on specific brokers/clients who defaulted on delivery obligations, with minimal broader market impact as this is a standard operational procedure.
