## Summary

BSE announces updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective August 4, 2025. Five new securities are being added to LT-ASM, six securities are moving to lower ASM stages, and thirteen securities are exiting the framework entirely.

## Key Points

- 5 new securities added to Long Term ASM Framework
- 6 securities moved to lower ASM stages (stages 1 and 3)
- 13 securities moving out of LT-ASM framework
- No securities moving to higher ASM stages
- No securities moving directly to Stage IV Long Term ASM
- Changes effective from August 4, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

Securities in LT-ASM framework are subject to enhanced surveillance measures including:
- Additional margin requirements
- Price bands and trading restrictions
- Enhanced disclosure requirements
- Regular monitoring by exchange

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ASM framework requirements
- Enhanced margin collection for securities under ASM
- Adherence to price band restrictions where applicable
- Regular monitoring of client positions in ASM securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 4, 2025 - All LT-ASM framework changes take effect

## Impact Assessment

The changes will affect trading in 24 securities across different categories. Securities entering LT-ASM will face enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions, while those exiting will have normal trading conditions restored. The movement of securities to lower ASM stages indicates improved market behavior and reduced surveillance requirements.
