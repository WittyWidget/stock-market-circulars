title: Consolidated Penalties for Trading-Limit and Position-Limit Violations Across
  Segments
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a consolidated summary of penalties applicable for trading limit violations (RRM violations) and position limit violations across various segments including Equity Cash, Equity Derivatives, Currency Derivatives, and Securities Lending & Borrowing (SLB). The circular provides a comprehensive penalty structure with escalating charges based on violation frequency, amount, and segment type. Penalties include daily charges of 0.07% plus fixed amounts ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 70,000 depending on violation instance and amount. Repeated violations (11th instance onwards) trigger referrals to the Member Committee for suitable action.

## Key Points

- Trading limit violations incur 0.07% per day penalty plus instance-based fixed charges
- Penalty structure differentiates between violations ≤ Rs 1 crore and > Rs 1 crore
- Escalating penalty framework: 1st instance has minimal penalty, increasing significantly for 6th-10th instances
- 11th instance onwards triggers Member Committee referral in addition to cumulative penalties
- Position limit violations for equity derivatives: 1% of violation value (min Rs 5,000, max Rs 1,00,000)
- Currency derivatives position limit violations: No penalty for 1st instance, escalating thereafter
- Client-level currency derivatives violations: Rs 5,000 per violation per client per day
- Ban period position violations carry 1% penalty of violation value with specified minimum/maximum caps
- Clearing members collect penalties and may recover from violating clients

## Regulatory Changes

This circular consolidates existing penalty frameworks across segments for ease of reference. No new regulatory changes are introduced; rather, it provides a comprehensive summary of current penalty structures for:

- Trading Limit Violations (RRM) across Equity Cash, Equity & Currency Derivatives
- Trading Limit Violations for Securities Lending & Borrowing
- Position Limit Violations at Trading Member/FPI/Mutual Fund levels (Equity Derivatives)
- Position Limit Violations at Trading Member and Client levels (Currency Derivatives)
- Position Limit Violations for Securities Lending & Borrowing
- Entity-level position violations during ban periods

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**
- Must monitor and adhere to trading limits across all segments to avoid escalating penalties
- Must track violation instances within each calendar month as penalties are cumulative
- Must be prepared for Member Committee referral after 11th violation instance
- Responsible for collecting and potentially recovering penalties from clients who commit violations

**For Clearing Members:**
- Must pay penalties collected by the Exchange on behalf of trading members and clients
- May recover penalty amounts from clients who committed the violations
- Must ensure client-level position limit compliance in currency derivatives (Rs 5,000 penalty per client per day)

**Penalty Calculation Requirements:**
- Track violation instances separately for different amount thresholds (≤ Rs 1 crore vs > Rs 1 crore)
- Calculate daily charges at 0.07% plus applicable fixed penalties
- For position limit violations: calculate violation value as violated quantity × underlying price

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date:** October 24, 2025
- **Effective Date:** Immediate (consolidation of existing penalty frameworks)
- **Monthly Reset:** Violation instance counting resets at the start of each calendar month

## Impact Assessment

**Financial Impact:**
- High financial impact for members with repeated violations due to escalating penalty structure
- Cumulative penalties can reach Rs 70,000+ fixed charges plus daily 0.07% for frequent violators
- Position limit violations in equity derivatives capped at Rs 1,00,000 per entity per stock per day

**Operational Impact:**
- Requires robust risk management systems to monitor trading and position limits in real-time
- Members need enhanced tracking mechanisms to count monthly violation instances across segments
- Potential operational disruption if referred to Member Committee (11th instance onwards)

**Risk Management:**
- Encourages stricter internal controls to prevent limit violations
- Creates deterrent effect through escalating penalty structure
- Clearing members bear responsibility for penalty collection, necessitating strong client oversight

**Market Impact:**
- Promotes market stability by discouraging excessive risk-taking through limit violations
- Ensures fair trading practices across all market segments
- Protects market integrity through stringent enforcement of position and trading limits
