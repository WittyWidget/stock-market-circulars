Quantities range from 1 share to over 360,000 shares depending on the security.

## Key Points

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine operational circular for demat auction pursuant to existing settlement failure procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members with outstanding delivery obligations for listed scrips must participate in the auction or arrange delivery
- Members must ensure sufficient funds/securities are available for auction settlement
- Buyers in original trades may need to participate in auction to close their positions
- All auction participants must comply with BSE's auction settlement procedures and timelines

## Important Dates

- **October 9, 2025**: Demat Auction circular published for Settlement No. 731
- Auction date and settlement timelines to follow as per BSE's standard auction calendar

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects 104 scrips across multiple sectors. While demat auctions are routine operational events, they indicate delivery failures in the settlement system. The presence of high quantities in certain scrips (particularly PVV Infra, STARLINEPS) may create temporary price volatility during auction.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and clearing members with failed delivery obligations must arrange for auction participation or face penalties. End investors holding these securities may experience temporary liquidity constraints if large auction quantities affect market prices.

**Investor Impact**: Investors who were buyers in the original failed trades may face delays in receiving securities and may need to participate in auctions at potentially different prices. Members with short positions in these scrips face auction risk and potential mark-to-market losses.
