## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a company-specific takeover offer affecting only shareholders of Hari Govind International Ltd. The offer size of 69.24 lakh shares represents a targeted acquisition that will not significantly impact broader market operations.

**Operational Impact**: Medium for participating members - Trading members and custodian members facilitating bids must ensure proper UCC registration, demat verification, and platform access. The 16-day offer period provides adequate time for operational execution.

**Investor Impact**: High for HARIGOV shareholders - Existing shareholders have the opportunity to tender their shares at Rs. 17.00 per share during the acquisition window. The offer price should be evaluated against current market price and company fundamentals.

**Platform Requirements**: Members must have active access to iBBS and RTRMS platforms. Contact details provided for technical support regarding login IDs, password resets, and OTB module queries through Trading Operations and Listing Sales departments.
