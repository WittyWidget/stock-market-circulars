## Summary

BEML Ltd (Scrip Code: 500048) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares. Each existing equity share with a face value of Rs. 10/- will be sub-divided into two equity shares of Rs. 5/- each. The record date for this corporate action is November 3, 2025, and the new denomination will be effective from the same date.

## Key Points

- Existing equity shares of Rs. 10/- face value will be split into two shares of Rs. 5/- each
- Record date fixed as November 3, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE258A01016) for Rs. 10/- shares will become invalid for exchange transactions from October 28, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs. 5/- shares will be communicated through a separate notice
- Sub-division effective from November 3, 2025
- Notice reference: DR-748/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action involving share sub-division permitted under existing regulations.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date of November 3, 2025
- System updates required to accommodate new share denomination and ISIN
- The old ISIN (INE258A01016) must not be used for transactions on or after October 28, 2025
- Trading members should await separate notice regarding new ISIN for Rs. 5/- paid-up shares

## Important Dates

- **October 14, 2025**: Circular issue date
- **October 28, 2025**: Last date for transactions using old ISIN (INE258A01016) for Rs. 10/- shares
- **November 3, 2025**: Record date for sub-division
- **November 3, 2025**: Effective date for new Rs. 5/- denomination

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Each shareholder will receive two shares of Rs. 5/- for every one share of Rs. 10/- held. The total investment value remains unchanged, but the number of shares doubles.

**Trading Impact**: Improved liquidity expected due to lower price per share post-split, making shares more accessible to retail investors. Trading systems must be updated to reflect new ISIN and denomination.

**Operational Impact**: Depository participants and trading members need to ensure their systems are ready to handle the ISIN change and share denomination adjustment before October 28, 2025.
