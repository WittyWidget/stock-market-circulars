## Summary

BSE has introduced a Pre-Open Session in the Equity Derivatives Segment with detailed technical specifications for market participants. The implementation uses existing ETI messaging format for order management while providing specific market data communication protocols across four distinct streams (EOBI, EMDI, MDI, NFCAST).

## Key Points

- ETI API messaging format remains unchanged for order management during pre-open session
- All existing order-related actions (addition, modification, deletion) can be performed using current ETI messages
- No auction-exclusive messages required for equity derivatives pre-open session
- Market data disseminated through four streams with specific messaging formats
- Session phases include Pre-open Order Entry, Pre-open Freeze, Pre-open Matching End, and Continuous Session

## Technical Specifications

### EOBI Stream Messages:
- Product State Message (Template ID: 13300) with TradingSessionSubID = 1
- Mass Instrument State Message (Template ID: 13301) with SecurityTradingStatus values: 4 (pre-open entry), 5 (freeze), 1 (matching end), 3 (continuous)
- Auction Clearing Price Message (Template ID: 13501) during pre-open session

### EMDI/MDI Stream Messages:
- SecurityMassTradingStatus values: 4 (pre-open entry), 5 (freeze), 0 (matching), 3 (continuous)

- Depth Incremental and Depth Snapshot messages for order actions
