## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Low - This is a routine IPO listing with no immediate market-wide implications. The listing adds a new equity security to the exchange but does not affect existing securities or market operations.

**Investor Impact:** Moderate for IPO subscribers - Lock-in periods of 1-3 years apply to specific shareholder categories (likely promoters and anchor investors), restricting liquidity for these holders. Retail investors who received IPO-free shares can trade immediately.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal - Standard listing procedures apply with no special surveillance or trading restrictions mentioned beyond the lock-in provisions.
