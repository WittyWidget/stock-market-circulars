- Effective date: August 18, 2025 (Ex-Date)
- Document Reference: DR-696/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

The equity shares of ALGOQUANT FINTECH LTD will have a new ISIN number following the approved sub-division of shares, changing the face value from Rs.2/- to Re.1/- per share.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update their systems with the new ISIN number
- All trades from August 18, 2025 onwards must use the new ISIN INE598D01035
- Investors should note the change in share denomination

## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment
