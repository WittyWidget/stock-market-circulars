## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The part redemption affects only holders of this specific privately placed debenture series. The reduction in face value to Rs. 58,333.33 per debenture reflects the partial return of principal to debenture holders. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value from October 20, 2025. No broader market implications are expected.
