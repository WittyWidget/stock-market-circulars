title: Ease of Doing Business - Rationalization and Standardization of Penalties Levied
  on Trading Members
---

## Summary

BSE has issued a circular rationalizing and standardizing penalties for trading members as part of ease of doing business initiatives. The framework categorizes violations with financial implications and prescribes specific actions for first-time and repeat instances, including monetary penalties, deposit blocking mechanisms, and disciplinary measures.

## Key Points

- **Client Fund Violations**: Penalties range from 0.07% to 0.10% per day for unavailability of client funds, with deposit blocking up to Rs. 10 crores after 30 days of continuous shortfall
- **Client Securities Misuse**: 2% penalty (max Rs. 1 lakh) for first instance, escalating to 3% (max Rs. 2 lakhs) for repeat violations
- **Net Worth Shortfall**: 5% penalty on shortfall amount with progressive deposit blocking (10% blocking for up to 10% shortfall, 100% blocking for over 50% shortfall)
- **Fixed Returns Prohibition**: Disciplinary action including suspension, terminal disablement, or expulsion for offering assured returns to clients
- **Inspection Non-Compliance**: Tiered penalties from Rs. 1,000-5,000 per day for non-QSB members and Rs. 2,000-10,000 per day for QSB members, with maximum penalty of Rs. 1 lakh

## Regulatory Changes

### Violations with Financial Implications - Classification

**Category 1: Non-availability of Client Funds**
- When recouped subsequently: 0.07% per day (up to 2 days/month) or 0.10% per day (over 2 days/month)
- If not recouped after 30 days: Referral for disciplinary action, no new clients, terminal disablement until recoupment
- Proprietary deposits blocked to extent of shortfall or Rs. 10 crores (whichever lower) for 10 days

**Category 2: Misuse of Client Securities/Commodities**
- First instance: 2% of misuse amount (max Rs. 1 lakh)
- Repeat instance: 3% of misuse amount (max Rs. 2 lakhs)

**Category 3: Net Worth Shortfall**
- Monetary penalty: 5% of shortfall amount
- Deposit blocking based on severity:
  - Up to 10% shortfall: 10% deposits blocked
  - 10-20% shortfall: 25% deposits blocked
  - 20-50% shortfall: 50% deposits blocked
  - Over 50% shortfall: 100% deposits blocked
- Repeat violations: 50% escalation in penalties

**Category 4: Offering Fixed/Assured Returns**
- Disciplinary action including no new clients, suspension, disablement, or expulsion as deemed appropriate

**Category 5: Inspection Non-Compliance**

Three sub-categories defined:

a) Non-cooperation resulting in non-completion:
- Non-QSB: Rs. 1,000/day (up to 7 days), Rs. 5,000/day thereafter (max Rs. 1 lakh)
- QSB: Rs. 2,000/day (up to 7 days), Rs. 10,000/day thereafter

b) Delay in submission of documents

c) Material wrong/incorrect data submission

## Compliance Requirements

### For All Trading Members:
1. Maintain adequate client funds segregation at all times to avoid daily penalty charges
2. Ensure client securities/commodities are not misused for proprietary or other purposes
3. Maintain minimum prescribed net worth and accurately report to the Exchange
4. Refrain from offering any fixed, assured, or periodic returns to clients or mobilizing deposits
5. Cooperate fully with inspection officials and provide complete, accurate data within prescribed timelines
6. Ensure proprietary deposits are available for blocking if violations occur
7. Recoup any shortfalls within 30 days to avoid severe disciplinary actions

### Deposit Blocking Mechanism:
- Deposits blocked after 2 trading days from communication
- Blocking period: 10 days
- No exposure granted on blocked deposits
- For multi-principle violations: aggregate amount blocked

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Effective Date**: Not explicitly mentioned; appears to be effective immediately
- **Deposit Blocking Timeline**: 2 trading days from communication of blocking direction
- **Blocking Duration**: 10 days
- **Critical Threshold**: 30 days of continuous shortfall triggers disciplinary referral

## Impact Assessment

### High Impact on Trading Members:

**Operational Impact:**
- Trading members must strengthen internal controls and compliance systems to avoid violations
- Enhanced monitoring required for client fund segregation and securities handling
- Immediate financial impact through daily penalty accrual for fund shortfalls
- Risk of terminal disablement affecting business continuity

**Financial Impact:**
- Direct penalties ranging from 0.07% per day to 5% of violation amounts
- Blocked deposits reduce available collateral and trading capacity
- Maximum single penalty can reach Rs. 10 crores for fund misuse violations
- Repeat violations face 50% penalty escalation

**Compliance Burden:**
- Increased documentation requirements for inspections
- Daily penalties for inspection delays create time-sensitive compliance pressure
- Net worth maintenance becomes critical with progressive blocking mechanism

**Market Discipline:**
- Standardized framework provides clarity and predictability
- Escalating penalties for repeat violations incentivize compliance
- Severe actions (suspension, expulsion) reserved for material violations
- Differentiated penalties for QSB vs non-QSB members recognize size differences

### Positive Aspects:
- Transparent, rule-based penalty structure reduces discretionary actions
- Ease of doing business through standardization
- Clear categorization helps members understand risk exposure
- Progressive enforcement allows remediation before severe actions
