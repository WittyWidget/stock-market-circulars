## Summary

Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company Limited (KMAMC) has temporarily suspended all fresh/additional lumpsum and switch-in transactions in Kotak Silver ETF Fund of Fund effective October 10, 2025. The suspension is due to domestic silver trading at a premium relative to international prices caused by physical silver shortage in the domestic market. All purchase/switch-in transactions timestamped on or before 3:00 PM on October 09, 2025 will be processed. Existing Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), Systematic Transfer Plans (STPs), and redemptions/switch-outs will continue to operate normally.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to investors specifically interested in Kotak Silver ETF Fund of Fund. Does not affect broader market operations or other mutual fund schemes.

**Investor Impact**: Moderate impact on investors seeking fresh exposure to silver through this fund. However, existing investors can continue SIPs and have full redemption flexibility. The suspension protects new investors from entering at elevated premium levels.

**Operational Impact**: Fund house operations adjusted to reject fresh lumpsum/switch-in transactions while maintaining normal processing for SIPs, STPs, and redemptions. The underlying Kotak Silver ETF continues to operate normally.

**Rationale**: The premium in domestic silver prices over international prices creates unfavorable entry conditions for new investors. Temporary suspension prevents investors from purchasing at inflated valuations, demonstrating investor protection measures by the AMC.
