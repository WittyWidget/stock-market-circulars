title: Periodic Call Auction for Illiquid Scrips - List of 49 Securities Effective
  October 10, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced that 49 securities will be moved to the periodic call auction mechanism effective October 10, 2025, due to their classification as illiquid scrips. These securities will no longer trade in continuous market sessions and will only be available for trading during designated periodic call auction sessions.

## Key Points

- 49 securities identified as illiquid will be moved to periodic call auction mechanism
- Effective date: October 10, 2025
- Securities span various sectors including finance, manufacturing, trading, and biotech
- All securities have BSE scrip codes and valid ISINs listed in the circular
- This is a regulatory measure to improve price discovery and reduce volatility in illiquid securities

## Regulatory Changes

Securities classified as illiquid based on BSE's surveillance criteria will be shifted from regular trading sessions to periodic call auction mechanism. This change restricts trading to specific auction sessions rather than continuous trading throughout the day.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform their clients holding these securities about the change in trading mechanism
- Orders for these securities can only be placed during periodic call auction sessions
- Settlement and clearing procedures will follow periodic call auction framework
- Investors should adjust their trading strategies accordingly for these scrips

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 10, 2025 - All 49 securities will begin trading exclusively in periodic call auction mechanism
- **Announcement Date:** October 7, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Trading in these 49 securities will become more restrictive with limited trading windows through periodic call auction sessions. This may further reduce liquidity but is intended to improve price discovery and prevent price manipulation.

**Investor Impact:** Existing investors in these securities will face reduced trading flexibility with orders executable only during auction sessions. Entry and exit from positions will require more planning.

**Operational Impact:** Brokers and trading members need to update their systems and client communication regarding the new trading mechanism for these scrips. Order placement and execution processes will differ from regular market operations.
