## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This circular affects only holders of specific debentures issued by Magnite Developers Private Limited, a private limited company. The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value of the debentures, which is a routine corporate action in debt markets.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to ensure their systems reflect the reduced face value from October 20, 2025 onwards to avoid settlement discrepancies. Debenture holders will receive partial redemption proceeds along with interest payment based on the record date.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders will receive partial return of principal along with interest, reducing their exposure to the issuer. The reduced face value will be reflected in subsequent trading and valuation of these instruments.
