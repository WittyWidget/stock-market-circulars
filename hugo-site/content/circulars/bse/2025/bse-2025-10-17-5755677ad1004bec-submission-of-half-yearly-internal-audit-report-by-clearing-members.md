## Summary

BSE requires clearing members to submit their half-yearly internal audit reports for the period ended September 30, 2025. The audit must cover critical areas including margin collection procedures, client fund and securities segregation, and compliance with fund-based activity restrictions. The report format includes detailed verification of margin collection in prescribed forms, segregation of client funds from proprietary funds, prohibition of cash dealings with trading members/custodial participants, and restrictions on pledging client securities.

## Key Points

- Half-yearly internal audit report submission required for clearing members
- Audit period: Half year ended September 30, 2025
- Covers both F&O and Currency segments
- Auditor must verify margin collection compliance per circular 20200710-45
- Sample-based verification required with detailed documentation
- Auditor observations must categorize findings as Complied (C), Non-Complied (NC), or Not Applicable (N.A.)
- Management comments on findings must indicate acceptance (Y/N)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular reinforces existing compliance requirements for clearing members to conduct and submit internal audits on a half-yearly basis.

## Compliance Requirements

### A. Margins

1. **Consolidated Crystallized Obligation Margins**: Verify that clearing members collected margins from Trading Members-Proprietary/Custodial Participants only in cash form (not FDRs/BGs) for F&O and Currency segments, except physical settlement components
2. **Adequate Margin Collection**: Confirm collection of appropriate EOD margins and peak margins in prescribed forms from trading members/custodial participants
3. **Margin Reporting Accuracy**: Ensure margins reported to Clearing Corporation match actual collections from trading members/custodial participants

### B. Client Funds and Securities Management

4. **Segregation**: Client (TM/CP) funds and securities/commodities must be segregated from proprietary funds and securities
5. **No Cash Dealings**: Prohibition on cash dealings with trading members/custodial participants
6. **Pledging Prohibition**: Members cannot pledge client securities to banks/NBFCs for raising funds, even with client authorization
7. **Activity Restrictions**: Members must not engage in activities involving personal financial liability unconnected to securities/commodities business
8. **Loan Facility Restrictions**: Verify whether members have availed loan facilities based on Client Bank Account/Upstreaming Account
9. **Borrowing/Lending Records**: Maintain records of monies borrowed or loaned per circulars 20220107-45 and 20220922-49
10. **Account Statements**: Statement of accounts must be sent to trading members/custodial participants
11. **Daily Margin Statements (DMS)**: Issue DMS to clients with specified details and maintain proof of delivery/dispatch

### Reporting Format

- Sample size verified
- Number of non-compliance instances
- Percentage of non-compliance
- Amount/value involved in non-compliance
- Management comments and acceptance status
- Applicability assessment

## Important Dates

- **Audit Period**: Half year ended September 30, 2025
- **Submission Deadline**: Not specified in the provided content (typically follows regulatory timeline)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact**: High - Clearing members must allocate resources for comprehensive internal audit covering multiple verification areas. Sample-based testing requires significant documentation and management review.

**Compliance Impact**: High - Mandatory submission with detailed verification requirements. Non-compliance in any area (margin collection, fund segregation, prohibited activities) could trigger regulatory scrutiny and potential penalties.

**Market Impact**: Medium - Ensures integrity of clearing and settlement system by verifying proper margin collection and client fund protection mechanisms. Strengthens investor confidence in market infrastructure.

**Risk Mitigation**: The audit framework identifies key risk areas including unauthorized use of client funds, inadequate margin collection, and fund-based activities that could compromise clearing member financial stability.
