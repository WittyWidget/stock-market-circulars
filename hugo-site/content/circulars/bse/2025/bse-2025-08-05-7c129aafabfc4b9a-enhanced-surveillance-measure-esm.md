title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework Updates
---

## Summary

BSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective August 6, 2025, adding new securities and moving existing ones to different surveillance stages. Two new securities have been shortlisted for ESM, while five existing securities will move to higher surveillance stages.

## Key Points

- 2 new securities added to ESM framework: Kizi Apparels Ltd and SDC Techmedia Ltd
- 5 securities moved to higher ESM stages including Bisil Plast Ltd, Dharan Infra-EPC Ltd, Gujarat Natural Resources Ltd, Viji Finance Ltd, and Vineet Laboratories Ltd
- No securities moved to lower ESM stages
- No securities removed from ESM framework
- Consolidated list shows 28 securities currently under various ESM stages

## Regulatory Changes

Enhanced surveillance measures impose additional trading restrictions and monitoring on selected securities based on various risk parameters and market behavior patterns.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must adhere to enhanced surveillance conditions for listed securities
- Special trading restrictions apply to securities under ESM framework
- Increased monitoring and reporting requirements for affected securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 6, 2025 - All ESM framework changes take effect

## Impact Assessment

The addition of new securities and elevation of existing ones to higher surveillance stages indicates increased regulatory scrutiny. This may result in reduced liquidity and increased volatility for affected securities as trading becomes more restrictive under enhanced surveillance measures.
