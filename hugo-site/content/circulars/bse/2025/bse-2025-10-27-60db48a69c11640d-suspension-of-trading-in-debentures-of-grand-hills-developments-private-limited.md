## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of Grand Hills Developments Private Limited effective October 30, 2025. The suspension is due to early redemption of the securities, with the company having set October 30, 2025 as the record date for this purpose. Trading members are advised not to deal in these debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Company: Grand Hills Developments Private Limited
- ISIN: INE0DWX07025
- Scrip Code: 975780
- Security: GHPL-11.70%-RR-7-3-26-PVT (Non-Convertible Debentures)
- Record Date: October 30, 2025
- No Dealings From: October 30, 2025
- Purpose: Early Redemption of NCDs
- Notice Number: DR-746/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for early redemption of debt securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not deal in the specified debentures from October 30, 2025
- Members must update their systems to reflect the trading suspension
- Investors holding these NCDs should prepare for early redemption on the record date

## Important Dates

- **October 27, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 30, 2025**: Record date for early redemption
- **October 30, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This affects a single privately placed NCD series with likely limited trading activity. Private placement debt securities typically have restricted investor base and lower liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Low to moderate for holders of these specific NCDs. Early redemption allows investors to receive principal back before maturity, though it may affect their investment plans if they were expecting to hold until the original maturity date of March 7, 2026.

**Operational Impact**: Routine operational update for trading members. Standard suspension procedure for corporate actions involving debt securities.
