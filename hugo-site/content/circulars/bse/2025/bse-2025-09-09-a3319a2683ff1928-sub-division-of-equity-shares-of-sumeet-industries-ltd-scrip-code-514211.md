## Summary

Sumeet Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 514211) has announced a subdivision of its equity shares with a record date of October 3, 2025. Each existing equity share of Rs.10 face value will be subdivided into five equity shares of Rs.2 face value each.

## Key Points

- Company: Sumeet Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 514211)
- Record Date: October 3, 2025
- Subdivision Ratio: 1:5 (One share of Rs.10 becomes five shares of Rs.2)
- Effective Date: October 3, 2025
- Current ISIN INE235C01028 (Rs.10 paid-up) will become invalid for trading from October 3, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs.2 paid-up shares to be announced separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE235C01028 for Rs.10 paid-up shares will not be valid for transactions on the Exchange on or after October 3, 2025. A new ISIN Number for the Rs.2 paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate notice.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note the subdivision details and prepare for the transition to the new share structure and ISIN effective October 3, 2025.

## Important Dates

- Record Date: October 3, 2025
- Effective Date for subdivision: October 3, 2025

This corporate action typically aims to improve liquidity and make shares more affordable for retail investors. Trading systems and portfolios will need to be updated to reflect the new share structure and ISIN.
