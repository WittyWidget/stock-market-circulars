title: Clarifications to Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) for
  SEBI Regulated Entities
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued clarifications regarding the implementation of the Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) for regulated entities. The circular clarifies two key aspects: the methodology for counting total registered clients based on unique PAN, and the criteria for categorizing trading members engaged in both clientele and proprietary trading.

## Key Points

- Registered clients must be counted based on unique PAN, including both active and inactive status
- Clients marked as 'Closed' in UCC database should be excluded from the count
- Trading members with clientele trading turnover less than 10% of proprietary trading turnover are categorized as proprietary stockbrokers
- Clarifications build upon previous SEBI circulars and FAQs issued between August 2024 and August 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The circular modifies the interpretation of Clause 2.1.1, Table 1 of SEBI Circular No. SEBI/HO/ITD-1/ITD_CSC_EXT/P/CIR/2025/60 dated April 30, 2025. The parameter for determining registered clients now explicitly includes active and inactive clients based on unique PAN, while excluding closed accounts.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must calculate registered clients using unique PAN methodology
- Entities engaged in both clientele and proprietary trading must assess their turnover ratio for the financial year (April 1 to March 31)
- Investment advisors and trading members must implement these clarifications for CSCRF compliance
- All regulated entities must follow the updated categorization criteria

## Important Dates

- Circular Issue Date: September 2, 2025
- Assessment Period for Proprietary Trading Classification: Financial year April 1 to March 31
- Previous Related Circulars: August 20, 2024; December 31, 2024; March 28, 2025; April 30, 2025; August 28, 2025
- FAQ Publication: June 11, 2025

## Impact Assessment

These clarifications will impact how SEBI regulated entities categorize themselves under the CSCRF framework. Trading members may be reclassified based on the 10% threshold for clientele versus proprietary trading turnover. The unique PAN-based client counting methodology provides a standardized approach for determining entity size and applicable cybersecurity requirements.
