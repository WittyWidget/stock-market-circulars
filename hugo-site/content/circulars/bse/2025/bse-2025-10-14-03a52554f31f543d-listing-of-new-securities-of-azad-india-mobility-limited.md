## Summary

BSE has listed 13,950,000 new equity shares of Azad India Mobility Limited in six tranches. The shares were allotted on two dates (August 7, 2025 and August 25, 2025) with distinctive numbers ranging from 4,04,93,155 to 5,44,43,154. Different batches have varying lock-in periods ending on either April 15, 2026 or April 15, 2027.

## Key Points

- Total new shares listed: 13,950,000 equity shares
- Six separate allotment tranches with distinct lock-in periods
- First allotment date: August 7, 2025 (8,805,000 shares)
- Second allotment date: August 25, 2025 (5,145,000 shares)
- Distinctive number range: 4,04,93,155 to 5,44,43,154
- Lock-in periods expire on either April 15, 2026 or April 15, 2027

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a standard listing notification.

## Compliance Requirements

- Lock-in restrictions must be observed for respective tranches until specified dates
- Shares cannot be traded before lock-in expiry dates
- Compliance with SEBI guidelines on promoter/investor lock-in requirements

## Important Dates

- **August 7, 2025**: First allotment date (8,805,000 shares across 3 tranches)
- **August 25, 2025**: Second allotment date (5,145,000 shares across 3 tranches)
- **April 15, 2026**: Lock-in expiry for tranches 2, 3, and 6 (8,950,000 shares)
- **April 15, 2027**: Lock-in expiry for tranches 1, 4, and 5 (7,000,000 shares)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Addition of 13.95 million shares represents significant dilution. Staggered lock-in release dates (2026 and 2027) may help absorb selling pressure gradually.

**Liquidity Impact**: Limited immediate impact as all shares are locked-in. Progressive unlock in 2026 (64% of shares) and 2027 (36% of shares) will increase floating stock.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders face dilution. New shareholders subject to lock-in restrictions cannot exit positions until respective unlock dates.
