## Summary

BSE has announced the listing and admission for trading of further securities issued by four companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS). The newly issued shares will be available for trading with effect from Monday, October 13, 2025. The companies include Sai Life Sciences Limited, Transport Corporation of India Ltd, UTI Asset Management Company Limited, and Wipro Ltd. None of the newly listed shares are under lock-in.

## Key Points

- Four companies have issued additional equity shares under ESOP/ESOS schemes
- Total shares listed: 268,564 shares across all four companies
- All new securities are admitted for trading effective October 13, 2025
- No lock-in period applies to any of the newly listed shares
- Sai Life Sciences Limited: 150,500 shares (Face Value: ₹1)
- Transport Corporation of India Ltd: 29,630 shares (Face Value: ₹2)
- UTI Asset Management Company Limited: 44,033 shares (Face Value: ₹10)
- Wipro Ltd: 44,401 shares (Face Value: ₹2)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced. This is a routine listing notification for securities issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading members of BSE are informed to take note of the newly listed securities and ensure their systems are updated to reflect the increased share capital and distinct number ranges for these companies.

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Effective Trading Date**: October 13, 2025 (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - The number of shares being listed is relatively small compared to the existing equity base of these large-cap and mid-cap companies. The addition represents marginal dilution and is unlikely to significantly affect trading patterns or stock prices.

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - This is a routine administrative listing process. Trading members need only update their records with the new distinct number ranges and increased share counts.

**Investor Impact**: Negligible - ESOP/ESOS allotments are standard corporate actions that are typically factored into market expectations. The absence of lock-in periods means these shares are immediately available for trading, though employee shareholders typically hold for longer periods.
