## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective October 08, 2025. Nine securities have been added to the ST-ASM framework (Stage I), while eight securities are moving out of the framework. The ST-ASM is a surveillance mechanism designed to monitor securities with abnormal price movements or volatility.

## Key Points

- 9 securities added to Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework effective October 08, 2025
- 8 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages
- Securities entering include Banco Products, BLT Logistics, KBS India, NIS Management, Orient Technologies, Raj Oil Mills, Sujala Trading & Holdings, Take Solutions, and V2 Retail
- Securities exiting include AAA Technologies (moving to ESM), Affordable Robotic & Automation, Deep Diamond India (moving to LT-ASM), Evoq Remedies, GTT Data Solutions, Nettlinx, OM Infra, and Zodiac Ventures
- Some exiting securities are transitioning to other surveillance frameworks (ESM, LT-ASM)

## Regulatory Changes

The Short Term ASM framework applies stricter surveillance measures to securities exhibiting unusual price movements or volatility patterns over 5/15/30 day periods. Securities under ST-ASM typically face:
- Enhanced disclosure requirements
- Potential trading restrictions
- Increased scrutiny of price movements
- Additional margin requirements for traders

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should adjust trading strategies for affected securities
- Enhanced due diligence required for securities entering ST-ASM
- Brokers must inform clients about increased surveillance measures
- Margin requirements may be higher for securities under ST-ASM
- Trading members should monitor the consolidated list of securities under ST-ASM

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 08, 2025 - Changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium impact on specific securities listed. Securities entering ST-ASM may experience reduced liquidity and increased trading costs due to higher margins and surveillance measures. The framework aims to protect investors from excessive volatility.

**Trading Impact**: Traders and investors in the 9 affected securities should expect potential changes in liquidity, bid-ask spreads, and margin requirements. The exit of 8 securities from ST-ASM may improve trading conditions for those stocks.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding securities entering ST-ASM should be aware of increased surveillance and potential trading restrictions. This may affect short-term trading strategies and position sizing.
