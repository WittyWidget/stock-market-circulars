## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - While 98 scrips are affected, the quantities for most blue-chip stocks are relatively small (1-431 shares). However, some mid and small-cap stocks have substantial quantities that may experience price volatility during the auction.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members with shortfalls must arrange for securities through the auction, potentially at unfavorable prices. The largest exposure is in WELCURE DRUGS (74,441 shares), followed by CENTRUM CAPITAL (20,000 shares) and Jaiprakash Power (9,000 shares).

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders of affected securities may experience temporary price movements during the auction process. Members who failed to deliver will bear the cost differential if auction prices are higher than settlement prices.
