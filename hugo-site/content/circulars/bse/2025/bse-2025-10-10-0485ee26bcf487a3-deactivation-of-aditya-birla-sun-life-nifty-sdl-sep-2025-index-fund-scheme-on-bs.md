  on BSE StAR MF Platform
---

## Summary

BSE has deactivated the ADITYA BIRLA SUN LIFE NIFTY SDL SEP 2025 INDEX FUND scheme on the BSE StAR MF Platform with immediate effect. The scheme matured and closed in September 2025, and consequently, no further Creation/Cancellation/Redemption of units will be possible at the AMC/RTA end. All existing systematic investment plans (SIP/XSIP/STP/SWP) registered under this scheme will be cancelled immediately.

## Key Points

- ADITYA BIRLA SUN LIFE NIFTY SDL SEP 2025 INDEX FUND scheme has been disabled on BSE StAR MF platform with immediate effect
- The scheme matured and closed in September 2025
- No further Creation/Cancellation/Redemption of units possible at AMC/RTA end
- BSE will cancel all existing SIP/XSIP/STP/SWP registered in this scheme immediately
- Communication received from ADITYA BIRLA SUN LIFE AMC

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must note the immediate deactivation of the scheme on BSE StAR MF platform
- Members should be aware that Exchange will cancel existing systematic investment plans (SIP/XSIP/STP/SWP) for this scheme
- No new transactions can be processed for this matured scheme

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: Immediate effect from October 10, 2025
- **Scheme Maturity**: September 2025
- **Notice Date**: October 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to investors and members dealing with this specific scheme. Since the scheme has already matured in September 2025, this deactivation is a procedural step following the natural conclusion of the fund's lifecycle. Investors with existing systematic plans in this scheme will see their arrangements automatically cancelled, requiring them to redirect investments to other schemes if desired. The operational impact on the broader market is minimal as this affects only one matured scheme.
