This circular has moderate impact limited to holders of KEERTANA FINSERV LIMITED debentures. The part redemption will return capital to debenture holders while reducing the outstanding principal amount. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value to ensure accurate pricing and settlement. The 11.40% coupon rate debentures will continue trading at the reduced face value, affecting position sizing and risk calculations for debt market participants. No broader market impact expected as this is a routine corporate action for a private placement debt security.
