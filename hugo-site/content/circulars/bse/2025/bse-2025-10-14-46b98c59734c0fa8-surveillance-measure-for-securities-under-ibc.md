title: Surveillance Measure for Securities under IBC - October 15, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has issued updated surveillance measures for securities of companies undergoing Insolvency Resolution Process (IRP) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The circular provides three annexures: securities shortlisted for various IBC stages effective October 15, 2025; securities moving to or being excluded from ASM; and a consolidated list of all securities currently under IBC surveillance framework.

## Key Points

- Carnation Industries Ltd (Scrip Code: 530609, ISIN: INE081B01028) has been shortlisted for Stage 1 Additional Surveillance Measure effective October 15, 2025
- No securities moved from Stage 0 (Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure) to Stage 1
- No securities moved between Stage 1 and Stage 2
- No securities were excluded from the IBC ASM framework as of October 14, 2025
- The consolidated list includes 14+ securities across various IBC stages, ranging from Stage 0 (receipt of disclosure) to Stage 1
- Notable companies in the consolidated list include Aban Offshore Ltd, AGS Transact Technologies Ltd, Alchemist Ltd, Alps Industries Ltd, Ansal Properties & Infrastructure Ltd, and Arshiya Limited

## Regulatory Changes

The surveillance framework continues to implement the IBC-based Additional Surveillance Measure with multiple stages:

- **Stage 0**: Receipt of corporate announcement/disclosure from the company regarding insolvency proceedings
- **Stage 1**: Securities enter formal Additional Surveillance Measure for companies in IRP under IBC
- **Stage 2**: Enhanced surveillance for companies with prolonged insolvency proceedings

The framework also identifies special categories including T+0 scrips shortlisted as per parent company and recommencement scrips.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of the surveillance status of securities under IBC proceedings
- Trading in Stage 1 securities is subject to Additional Surveillance Measures which may include trade-for-trade settlement, price bands, or other restrictions
- Investors should exercise additional caution when trading securities under IBC surveillance stages
- Companies under IBC proceedings must continue to make necessary disclosures as per regulatory requirements

## Important Dates

- **October 15, 2025**: Effective date for Carnation Industries Ltd moving to Stage 1 ASM
- **October 15, 2025**: Effective date for updated Stage 0 and Stage 1 lists
- **October 14, 2025**: Reference date for securities to be excluded from ASM (though none were excluded)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The addition of one security (Carnation Industries) to Stage 1 surveillance has limited immediate market-wide impact but signals heightened risk for that specific security. The consolidated list shows 14+ companies remain under various stages of IBC surveillance, indicating ongoing corporate stress in certain segments.

**Trading Impact**: Securities in Stage 1 typically face enhanced surveillance measures that may reduce liquidity and increase volatility. Carnation Industries shareholders and traders should expect potential restrictions on trading.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding securities listed in the IBC framework should monitor developments closely as insolvency proceedings can lead to significant value erosion or complete write-offs. The framework provides transparency on which securities carry elevated insolvency risk.

**Sectoral Impact**: The diverse nature of companies under IBC surveillance (ranging from offshore services, technology, metals, real estate, to textiles) suggests stress is not concentrated in a single sector but spread across multiple industries.
