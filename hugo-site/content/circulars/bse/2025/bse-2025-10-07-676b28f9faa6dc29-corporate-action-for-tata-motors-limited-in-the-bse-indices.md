## Summary

BSE Limited will conduct a Special Pre-Open Session (SPOS) on Tuesday, October 14, 2025 to enable price discovery for Tata Motors Limited (Ticker: 500570, TATAMOTORS) following its demerger. As part of the scheme of arrangement, TML Commercial Vehicles Limited will be added to 25 BSE indices at zero price effective from October 14, 2025 (after close of October 13, 2025) without divisor adjustment.

## Key Points

- Special Pre-Open Session scheduled for October 14, 2025 for Tata Motors Limited price discovery post-demerger
- TML Commercial Vehicles Limited to be added to 25 BSE indices at zero price
- Addition effective from October 14, 2025 after close of October 13, 2025
- No divisor adjustment will be made for the index additions

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should prepare for the Special Pre-Open Session on October 14, 2025
- Index tracking funds and portfolios will need to accommodate the new constituent TML Commercial Vehicles Limited
- For additional queries, clients should contact bseindex@bseindia.com

- **October 14, 2025**: Special Pre-Open Session for price discovery; TML Commercial Vehicles Limited added to indices

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - This demerger affects one of India's largest automotive companies and a BSE SENSEX constituent. The Special Pre-Open Session is critical for establishing fair price discovery for both entities post-demerger.

**Index Impact**: High - TML Commercial Vehicles Limited will be added to 25 major BSE indices including BSE SENSEX, BSE 100, BSE 200, BSE 500, BSE AUTO, and multiple thematic and strategy indices. This will impact index-tracking funds, ETFs, and institutional portfolios.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Market participants, particularly index funds and algorithmic trading systems, need to adjust for the new security and ensure systems are ready for the SPOS mechanism.
