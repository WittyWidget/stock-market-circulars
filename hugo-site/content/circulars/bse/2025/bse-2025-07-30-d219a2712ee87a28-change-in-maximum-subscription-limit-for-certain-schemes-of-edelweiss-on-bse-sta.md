## Summary

Edelweiss Asset Management Limited has increased the daily subscription limit for its Greater China Equity Off-Shore Fund from INR 10 lakh to INR 25 lakh per PAN per day, effective July 31, 2025. This change is based on available headroom for overseas investment limits set at the mutual fund level as of February 1, 2022.

## Key Points

- Daily subscription limit increased from INR 10 lakh to INR 25 lakh per PAN for Edelweiss Greater China Equity Off-Shore Fund
- Change applies to lump sum investments, switch-ins, SIPs, and STPs
- Effective date: July 31, 2025
- Based on transaction reporting date
- Existing systematic transactions (SIPs/STPs) remain unaffected
- All other offshore funds maintain INR 10 lakh per PAN per day limit

## Regulatory Changes

The increase is pursuant to SEBI letter SEBI/HO/OW/IMD-II/DOF3/25095/2022 dated June 17, 2022, which allowed mutual funds to resume subscriptions up to available headroom without breaching overseas investment limits as of February 1, 2022.

## Compliance Requirements

- Necessary changes will be made to Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)
- This addendum forms integral part of SID/KIM/SAI and overrides conflicting provisions
- Investment managers must adhere to revised daily limits

## Important Dates

- **July 31, 2025**: Effective date for revised subscription limit
- **July 30, 2025**: Cut-off date - transactions before this date not subject to revised limit
- **April 9, 2025**: Date of previous notice regarding subscription limits

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this affects only one specific mutual fund scheme. The change provides greater flexibility for investors in the Edelweiss Greater China Equity Off-Shore Fund while maintaining controlled exposure to overseas investments. Other offshore funds remain unaffected, ensuring overall risk management framework stays intact.
