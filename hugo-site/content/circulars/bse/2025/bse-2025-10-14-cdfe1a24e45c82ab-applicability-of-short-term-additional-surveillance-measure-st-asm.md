## Summary

BSE has updated the list of securities under the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective October 15, 2025. Three securities have been newly shortlisted under the 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework, while six securities are moving out of the framework. No securities are moving to higher or lower stages within the framework.

## Key Points

- 3 new securities added to ST-ASM Framework: Cargotrans Maritime Ltd, Niraj Cement Structurals Ltd, and Shiv Texchem Ltd
- 6 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework: ABM Knowledgeware Ltd, Bazel International Ltd, Dharani Finance Ltd, Khyati Multimedia Entertainment Ltd, LGT Business Connextions Ltd, and SP Capital Financing Ltd
- No securities moving to higher or lower stages within ST-ASM
- Changes effective from October 15, 2025
- Consolidated list includes securities across Stage I and Stage II classifications
- Multiple SME scrips included in the surveillance framework

## Regulatory Changes

The ST-ASM framework continues to apply 5/15/30 days surveillance measures to identified securities. Securities are being moved in and out based on market behavior and surveillance criteria. Some securities exiting ST-ASM are being transferred to other surveillance frameworks including LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge Framework, and ESM Framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must be aware of securities under ST-ASM framework
- Enhanced surveillance and monitoring applies to all listed securities in the framework
- Different trading restrictions apply based on the ASM stage (Stage I or Stage II)
- Special considerations for SME scrips and T+0 scrips as marked in the circular

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 15, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 3 securities to ST-ASM framework will result in enhanced surveillance and potentially stricter trading conditions for these scrips. The removal of 6 securities indicates improved market behavior or transfer to other appropriate surveillance frameworks. The consolidated list shows ongoing monitoring of securities exhibiting abnormal price movements or trading patterns. Trading volumes and liquidity may be impacted for securities entering or exiting the framework.
