## Summary

BSE has issued revised formats for submission of applications related to changes in designated directors for trading members and corporate entities. The circular provides comprehensive documentation requirements, eligibility criteria, and procedural guidelines for resignation, appointment, and re-designation of designated directors. The process involves prior approval from the Exchange/Clearing Corporation with specific documentation requirements.

## Key Points

- Designated directors must be at least 21 years of age
- Minimum two years of capital market experience required as per Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957
- Educational qualification must be at least HSC or equivalent
- Seven main document categories required: Application form, Board resolutions, PAN card, Address proof, Experience proof, Educational qualification, and Standard undertaking
- Multiple board resolution formats provided for different scenarios (resignation, appointment, re-designation)
- Address proof options include Aadhaar card with consent, Passport, Voter ID, utility bills, or bank statements (not older than two months)
- Experience must be with specified entities including stock brokers, sub-brokers, AMCs, merchant bankers, mutual funds, or IOSCO affiliated foreign entities
- Educational certificates must be certified by CA/CS; name change proof required if certificates are in different name

## Regulatory Changes

The circular introduces standardized and revised formats for designated director change applications, replacing previous formats. Key changes include:

- Structured document reference numbering system (CDD-1 through CDD-7)

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**
Medium impact on trading members and corporate entities planning changes in designated directors. Organizations must ensure compliance with revised documentation formats and enhanced verification requirements.

**Market Impact:**
Minimal direct market impact as this is an administrative compliance matter affecting member governance structure rather than trading operations.

**Affected Entities:**
- Stock brokers and trading members
- Clearing members
- Corporate entities registered with BSE
- Designated directors (incoming and outgoing)

**Benefits:**
- Standardized documentation process reduces ambiguity
- Clear eligibility criteria ensures qualified personnel in designated director roles
- Enhanced verification requirements improve governance standards
- Streamlined approval process with defined document checklist

**Challenges:**
- Members must update internal processes to align with new formats
- Additional certification requirements (CA/CS for educational documents)
- Stricter recency requirements for address proofs may require fresh documentation
- Comprehensive experience documentation needed from previous employers
