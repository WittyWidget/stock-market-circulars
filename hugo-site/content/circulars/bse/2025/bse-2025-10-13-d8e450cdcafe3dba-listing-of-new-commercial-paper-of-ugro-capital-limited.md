## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine commercial paper listing that adds short-term debt instruments to the BSE Debt segment. The commercial paper provides short-term financing to UGRO CAPITAL LIMITED for approximately 5 months.

**Investor Impact**: Low. The high credit rating (IND A1+) indicates strong creditworthiness. The securities are available for institutional and qualified investors participating in the debt market segment.

**Liquidity**: The standard denomination of Rs. 5 lakhs restricts participation to institutional investors and high net-worth individuals, limiting retail participation and potentially affecting secondary market liquidity.
