- **October 20, 2025**: No dealings/trading suspension begins
- **October 21, 2025**: Record date for redemption and interest payment eligibility

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. The suspension affects only one specific debenture series of a private limited company, limiting the broader market impact. Debenture holders will need to hold their positions through the record date to be eligible for redemption proceeds and interest payment.

**Investor Impact**: Medium for affected debenture holders. Investors holding this specific debenture will be unable to trade it from October 20, 2025. Those holding on the record date (October 21, 2025) will receive redemption proceeds and accrued interest.

**Operational Impact**: Routine procedural impact on trading members who must ensure compliance with the trading suspension and update their systems accordingly to prevent inadvertent transactions in the affected security.
