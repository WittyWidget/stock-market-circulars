## Summary

BSE has announced that trading in Rights Entitlements (REs) for renunciation of Delphi World Money Limited will commence from October 27, 2025. The REs will trade under scrip code 751050 (DELPH-RE) with ISIN INE726L20019 on a T+1 rolling settlement basis until November 03, 2025. The underlying Rights Issue opens on October 27, 2025 and closes on November 07, 2025.

## Key Points

- Rights Entitlements trading permitted for Delphi World Money Limited from October 27, 2025 to November 03, 2025
- Scrip Code: 751050, Scrip ID: DELPH-RE, ISIN: INE726L20019
- Market lot: 1, Group: R
- Settlement on T+1 rolling settlement basis, trade-for-trade
- Rights Entitlements tradable in dematerialized form only
- Rights Issue period: October 27, 2025 to November 07, 2025
- Trading members must inform clients with disclaimer in contract notes
- Unsubscribed and unrenounced REs will lapse after issue closing date

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. Trading members are referred to existing notices 20200305-21 (March 05, 2020) and 20200518-34 (May 18, 2020) for detailed guidelines on Rights Entitlements trading.

## Compliance Requirements

**For Trading Members:**

- Inform all clients about commencement of trading in REs with correct ISIN (INE726L20019)
- Ensure clients understand REs are not ordinary shares of the company
- Include prominent disclaimer in contract notes/bills for RE purchases stating:
  - Purchase of REs only provides right to participate in ongoing Rights Issue by making application with requisite money, or to renounce the REs before issue closes
  - REs neither subscribed nor renounced on or before Issue Closing Date will lapse and be extinguished
- Follow T+1 rolling settlement on trade-for-trade basis
- Ensure all RE trades are in dematerialized form only

## Important Dates

- **October 23, 2025**: Notice date
- **October 27, 2025**: 
  - RE trading period begins
  - Rights Issue opens
- **November 03, 2025**: RE trading period ends
- **November 07, 2025**: Rights Issue closes (last date for subscription/renunciation)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - affects only shareholders and potential investors of Delphi World Money Limited during the 8-day trading window for renunciation.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must ensure proper client communication and contract note disclaimers. The 7-day RE trading period (Oct 27 - Nov 03) is shorter than the full 12-day Rights Issue period (Oct 27 - Nov 07), requiring shareholders to decide on renunciation before the RE trading window closes.

**Investor Impact:** Shareholders must act within specified timeframes - either subscribe to the rights issue with payment, renounce their REs through trading, or allow them to lapse. The dematerialization requirement means physical shareholders cannot participate in RE trading.
