## Impact Assessment

The listing of these ESOP/ESOS shares represents routine corporate actions with minimal market impact. The total issuance of 247,871 shares across five companies is relatively small and unlikely to affect stock liquidity or pricing materially. IIFL Capital Services has the largest issuance at 107,610 shares, followed by Keystone Realtors at 80,101 shares. The absence of lock-in restrictions means these shares can be traded immediately, though employees typically retain shares for tax optimization purposes. This is a standard administrative notification for tracking purposes by market participants.
