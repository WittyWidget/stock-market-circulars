## Compliance Requirements

- Buy and sell orders must fall within the applicable price band percentage limits
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 9, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The revised price bands indicate these securities are under enhanced surveillance, likely due to volatility concerns or unusual trading patterns. Securities with tighter price bands (2%) face the most significant trading restrictions, potentially reducing liquidity but protecting investors from extreme price movements. The 20% price band for 3i Infotech Ltd and JD Cables Ltd represents a relaxation compared to tighter surveillance measures, while the 2% bands on three companies indicate the highest level of trading restrictions.
