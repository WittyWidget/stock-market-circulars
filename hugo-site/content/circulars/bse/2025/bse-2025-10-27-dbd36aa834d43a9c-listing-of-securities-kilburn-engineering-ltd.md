## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The listing increases Kilburn Engineering's equity base by 2.4 million shares, representing potential dilution for existing shareholders. The 7-month lock-in period means these shares will not impact immediate market supply. The preferential allotment to Non-Promoters indicates capital raising for business expansion or debt reduction.

**Liquidity Impact**: Medium - While 2.4 million additional shares will eventually increase free float, the lock-in period delays any immediate liquidity impact until May 2026.

**Investor Consideration**: Investors should monitor the company's use of the Rs. 39.84 crore raised (2.4M shares Ã— Rs. 166) and assess whether the warrant conversion reflects positive business sentiment from strategic investors.
