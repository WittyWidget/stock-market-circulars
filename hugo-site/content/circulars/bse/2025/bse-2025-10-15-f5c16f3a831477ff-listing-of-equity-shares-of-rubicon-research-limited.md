## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The listing adds a new stock to BSE with a substantial number of shares. However, approximately 14.67 crore shares (89%) are under various lock-in periods, limiting immediate free float and potential volatility.

**Liquidity Impact:** Only approximately 1.8 crore shares (11%) are available for immediate trading without lock-in restrictions, which may result in lower liquidity initially.

**Investor Categories Affected:** 
- Anchor investors with staggered release (30/90 days)
- Promoters/strategic investors with long-term lock-ins (1-3 years)
- Alternative Investment Funds (360 ONE group) with specific lock-in until March 2026
- Public investors with shares not under lock-in
- ESOP holders
