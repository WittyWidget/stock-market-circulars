## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must account for shut periods when planning SLB transactions
- Trading members should ensure clients are aware of ex-dates for entitlement determination
- Settlement obligations must be managed around foreclosure dates for spin-off events
- All corporate action adjustments must be reflected in positions and accounts

## Important Dates

- **October 14, 2025**: Ex-date and foreclosure date for Tata Motors spin-off; shut period October 13-14
- **October 15, 2025**: Ex-date and foreclosure date for SKF India spin-off; shut period October 14-15

- **October 24, 2025**: Ex-date and record date for Indian Railway Finance Corporation dividend; shut period October 23-24

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects SLB segment operations for four major securities. The spin-off events for Tata Motors and SKF India are particularly significant as they involve corporate restructuring that will impact derivative positions and borrowing-lending arrangements.

**Operational Impact**: Market participants with open SLB positions in these securities must manage their positions around the foreclosure dates for spin-offs and adjust for dividend entitlements. The shut periods will temporarily restrict new SLB transactions in these securities, potentially affecting liquidity and trading strategies.

**Investor Impact**: Investors with long positions on record dates will be entitled to dividends. Those involved in SLB arrangements must understand how spin-off events affect their borrowed/lent securities and ensure proper settlement.
