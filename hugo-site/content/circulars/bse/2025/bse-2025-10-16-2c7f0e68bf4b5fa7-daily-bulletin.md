## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Multiple high-value dividend announcements from blue-chip companies (Infosys, Cyient, Godrej) will result in significant cash outflows and may cause price adjustments post-record dates. The Infosys dividend of Rs. 23 per share represents a substantial payout.

**Investor Impact**: High for shareholders of dividend-paying companies who must hold shares through record dates to receive benefits. Debt security holders will receive scheduled interest payments and partial redemptions as per terms.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Routine corporate actions that exchanges and depositories handle regularly through established processes. Trading members need to track multiple record dates for proper settlement.

**Liquidity Impact**: Low to Medium - Some securities may see increased trading activity around ex-dividend dates as investors position for dividends. COVIDH right issue will create entitlement trading activity.
