title: Temporary Suspension of Subscription in Axis Silver Fund of Fund
---

## Summary

Axis Asset Management Company Limited has temporarily suspended acceptance of lump-sum and switch-in subscriptions in Axis Silver Fund of Fund effective post 3:00 PM on October 13, 2025. The suspension is due to pricing distortions in domestic silver ETF markets caused by heightened demand and ongoing supply constraints. Since the fund invests in Axis Silver ETF units, any premium in the underlying ETF directly impacts the fund's valuation, potentially exposing new investors to short-term pricing anomalies.

## Key Points

- Temporary suspension of lump-sum and switch-in subscriptions effective after 3:00 PM on October 13, 2025
- Suspension applies only to new subscriptions; redemptions remain unrestricted
- Fresh registrations under systematic transaction facilities are not affected
- Existing systematic transaction installments will continue as scheduled
- Cause: Pricing distortions in domestic silver ETFs due to demand-supply imbalances
- The fund invests in Axis Silver ETF, making it vulnerable to underlying ETF premiums
- Suspension duration: Until further notice from Axis AMC
- Notice number: 71/2025-26

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational measure taken by Axis AMC under its discretionary powers to protect investor interests during market distortions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Distributors and intermediaries must not accept lump-sum or switch-in applications for Axis Silver Fund of Fund received after 3:00 PM on October 13, 2025
- Investors must be informed about the temporary suspension and its rationale
- This notice-cum-addendum forms an integral part of the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)

## Important Dates

- **October 13, 2025, 3:00 PM**: Cut-off time - last acceptance of lump-sum/switch-in subscriptions
- **Post October 13, 2025, 3:00 PM**: Suspension effective until further notice

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: New investors seeking to invest lump-sum amounts or switch into Axis Silver Fund of Fund will be unable to do so until the suspension is lifted. However, existing investors can continue their SIPs and redeem units without restriction.

**Market Impact**: Limited direct market impact as this affects only one fund scheme. The measure reflects broader pricing challenges in the domestic silver ETF market due to demand-supply mismatches.

**Risk Mitigation**: The suspension protects new investors from entering at potentially inflated valuations caused by temporary market distortions in the underlying silver ETF, demonstrating prudent fund management practices.

**Alternative Investment Routes**: Investors can still register for new systematic investment plans (SIPs) and existing SIP installments will continue, providing ongoing investment opportunities despite the lump-sum suspension.
