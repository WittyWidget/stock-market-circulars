2. **Inter Globe Finance Ltd** (Scrip Code: 511391, ISIN: INE661M01016)

- Aarey Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Stage II)
- Achyut Healthcare Ltd (Stage II)
- Agio Paper & Industries Ltd (Stage II)
- Multiple other securities across Stage I and Stage II classifications

## Regulatory Framework

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure framework is designed to:
- Alert investors about securities with abnormal price movements
- Apply additional surveillance and monitoring mechanisms
- Implement stricter margin requirements and position limits
- Restrict trading to specific settlement types (often Trade-for-Trade)
- Protect market integrity and investor interests

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 16, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: Securities under ESM face additional trading restrictions including higher margin requirements, potential trade-for-trade settlement (no intraday trading), and increased scrutiny. Movement to higher ESM stages typically results in further restrictions.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should expect reduced liquidity, higher transaction costs, and more stringent position limits. The ESM designation serves as a caution signal about potential volatility or compliance concerns.

**Market Impact**: The addition and stage movements reflect BSE's ongoing surveillance efforts to maintain market integrity and protect investors from securities exhibiting unusual trading patterns or fundamental concerns.
