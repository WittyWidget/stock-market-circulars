## Key Points

- Trading suspension effective September 26, 2025 (30 days from notice date)
- Non-compliance with Regulation 33 for two consecutive quarters (December 2024 & March 2025)

- Complete freezing of promoter shareholding and all securities in promoter demat accounts during suspension
- Trade-for-trade basis allowed in Z group only on first trading day of each week after 15 days of suspension

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of SEBI Master Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/PoD2/CIR/P/0155 dated November 11, 2024 regarding penal actions for non-compliance with SEBI LODR Regulations 2015.

## Compliance Requirements

- Companies must comply with all SEBI LODR provisions by September 23, 2025 to avoid suspension
- Payment of prescribed fines required for revocation
- Must follow prescribed procedure and extant norms for suspension revocation
- Ongoing compliance with quarterly financial disclosure requirements under Regulation 33

## Important Dates

- **August 26, 2025**: Notice issued
- **September 23, 2025**: Final compliance deadline to avoid suspension
- **September 26, 2025**: Trading suspension effective date
- **15 days post-suspension**: Trade-for-trade basis commences (first trading day of each week for 6 months)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Complete loss of liquidity for affected securities, potential price volatility upon resumption. **Operational Impact**: Promoter shareholding freeze restricts corporate actions and governance activities. **Investor Impact**: Limited trading opportunities with trade-for-trade restrictions affecting investment strategies. Companies face reputational damage and increased compliance costs for revocation.
