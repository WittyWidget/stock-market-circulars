  2025
---

## Summary

Zodiac Ventures Limited (Scrip Code: 503641) has extended the closing date of its rights issue from 14th August 2025 to 25th August 2025. The decision was made by the Rights Issue Committee to provide shareholders additional opportunity to exercise their rights. The extension affects the entire post-issue timeline including allotment and listing dates.

## Key Points

- Rights issue originally scheduled to close on 14th August 2025 now extended to 25th August 2025
- Issue opened on 31st July 2025 as per original schedule
- Last date for Common Application Form (CAF) submission with payment is now 25th August 2025
- All other terms and conditions of the Letter of Offer remain unchanged
- Decision taken by Rights Issue Committee meeting held on 13th August 2025 (2:00 p.m. to 2:20 p.m.)

## Regulatory Changes

No changes to the Letter of Offer (LOF), Abridged LOF, and Common Application Form except for the revised closing date and consequent adjustments to the post-issue timeline.

## Compliance Requirements

- Eligible equity shareholders must submit duly filled Common Application Form with payment by 25th August 2025
- Shareholders entitled to rights issue should note the revised closing date
- On-market renunciation remains available until 8th August 2025

## Important Dates

- **Issue Opening Date**: 31st July 2025 (Thursday)
- **Last Date for On-Market Renunciation**: 8th August 2025 (Friday) 
- **Revised Issue Closing Date**: 25th August 2025 (Monday)
- **Basis of Allotment Finalization**: 1st September 2025 (Monday)
- **Date of Allotment**: 3rd September 2025 (Wednesday)
- **Date of Credit**: 6th September 2025 (Saturday)
- **Date of Listing**: 8th September 2025 (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

The extension provides existing shareholders additional time to participate in the rights issue, potentially improving subscription rates. However, it delays the overall timeline for allotment and listing by approximately 11 days. This may affect investors' capital deployment plans and the company's fundraising timeline.
