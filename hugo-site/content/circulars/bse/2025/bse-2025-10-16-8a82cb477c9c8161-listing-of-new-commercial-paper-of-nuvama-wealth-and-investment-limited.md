**Operational Impact:** Low - Affects only debt segment trading members and institutional investors participating in commercial paper markets. The 15-day tenure indicates very short-term liquidity management instrument.

**Issuer Impact:** Neutral - Routine treasury operation for Nuvama Wealth and Investment Limited to raise short-term funds at competitive rates backed by strong credit ratings (A1+ from both CARE and CRISIL).
