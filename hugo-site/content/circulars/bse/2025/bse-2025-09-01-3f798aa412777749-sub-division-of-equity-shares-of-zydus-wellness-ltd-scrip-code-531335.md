## Summary

Zydus Wellness Ltd (Scrip Code: 531335) has announced a sub-division of its equity shares with a record date of September 18, 2025. Each existing equity share of Rs.10 face value will be sub-divided into five equity shares of Rs.2 face value each.

## Key Points

- Company: Zydus Wellness Ltd (Scrip Code: 531335)
- Record Date: September 18, 2025
- Sub-division ratio: 1 share of Rs.10 into 5 shares of Rs.2 each
- Effective date: September 18, 2025
- Current ISIN (INE768C01010) will become invalid from the effective date
- New ISIN for Rs.2 paid-up shares to be announced separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE768C01010 for Rs.10 paid-up shares will not be valid for exchange transactions on or after September 18, 2025. A new ISIN number for the Rs.2 paid-up shares will be communicated through a separate market notice.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date and effective date for the sub-division
- All transactions involving the old ISIN must be completed before September 18, 2025
- Members must await the new ISIN notification for post-subdivision trading

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: September 18, 2025
- **Effective Date**: September 18, 2025
- **Last trading date with old ISIN**: September 17, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This share sub-division will increase the number of shares in circulation by 5x while reducing the face value proportionally. The action typically aims to improve liquidity and make shares more accessible to retail investors. Trading will be temporarily affected during the transition to the new ISIN, but overall market impact is expected to be neutral as the total value remains unchanged.
