## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The preferential allotment of 1.32 crore shares increases the company's equity capital and may impact liquidity. However, with majority shares under lock-in until 2026-2027, immediate trading supply will be limited.

**Shareholder Impact:** Existing shareholders face dilution from this preferential issue. The lock-in periods indicate long-term commitment from allottees, potentially signaling confidence in the company's prospects.

**Trading Impact:** Limited immediate impact on trading as most shares are locked-in. Full trading liquidity from these shares will only be available after lock-in periods expire.
