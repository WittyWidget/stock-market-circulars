- International Data Management (Security Code: 517044, ISIN: INE649R01010) moves to GSM Stage IV
- Securities marked with (#) move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in ESM Framework
- Securities marked with ($) move to lower GSM stages due to inclusion in IBC Framework

## Regulatory Changes

Movement to different GSM stages brings varying levels of surveillance measures and trading restrictions based on the assigned stage.

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must comply with enhanced disclosure requirements as per their assigned GSM stage
- Investors should be aware of the additional surveillance measures applicable to these securities
- Stock brokers need to implement appropriate risk management measures for GSM securities
