## Important Dates

- **October 8, 2025**: Circular notice date
- **October 15, 2025**: Record date for determining shareholder entitlement
- **October 15, 2025**: Ex-entitlement date (Settlement No. DR-736/2025-2026)
- **October 15, 2025**: Transfer to 'T' Group effective date
- **October 15, 2025**: Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) date

## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: All shareholders holding equity shares in SKF India Ltd as of the record date will receive equivalent shares in the newly formed SKF India (Industrial) Limited on a 1:1 basis. This will result in shareholders owning stakes in two separate companies post-demerger.

**Trading Impact**: The transfer to 'T' Group and implementation of Special Pre-open Session indicates heightened regulatory oversight during the demerger process. Trading will be restricted to call auction format during SPOS on October 15, 2025, which may impact liquidity and price discovery.

**Market Impact**: This is a significant corporate restructuring that will create a new listed entity. The resulting company will be listed on BSE Limited, expanding the number of investable securities in the SKF group.

**Operational Impact**: The demerger separates the Automotive and Industrial Business Undertaking into a focused entity, potentially allowing for better operational management and strategic focus for both companies post-separation.
