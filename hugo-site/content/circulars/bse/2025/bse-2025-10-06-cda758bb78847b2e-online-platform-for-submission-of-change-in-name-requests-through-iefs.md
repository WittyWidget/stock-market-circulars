## Summary

BSE has launched an online platform through the Issuer Electronic Filing System (IEFS) portal that enables members to submit Change in Name requests electronically. The portal is accessible at https://iefs.bseindia.in and requires members to use their clearing code as both member code and login ID. First-time users must reset their password using the forget password feature.

## Key Points

- Online submission of Change in Name requests now available through IEFS portal
- Members use their clearing code as both member code and login ID
- First-time users must reset password before accessing the system
- Email confirmation sent to registered email ID upon successful submission
- Navigation path: IEFS >> Change in Name >> Change in Name Form

## Regulatory Changes

Introduction of electronic filing system for name change requests, replacing or supplementing previous submission methods.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members must use IEFS portal at https://iefs.bseindia.in for name change submissions
- First-time users required to reset password using forget password functionality
- Members must have registered email ID for receiving confirmation notifications
- Login credentials: Member code and Login ID both correspond to clearing code (e.g., if clearing code is 123456, both fields use 123456)

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: October 6, 2025 (circular date)

## Impact Assessment

This is a procedural enhancement that streamlines the name change request process for BSE members. The impact is limited to operational efficiency improvements for members and BSE staff. No market impact or trading implications. The online system provides better tracking, faster processing, and automated email confirmations compared to manual submission processes.
