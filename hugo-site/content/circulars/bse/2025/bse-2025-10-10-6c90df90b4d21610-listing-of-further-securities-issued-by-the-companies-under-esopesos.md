## Summary

BSE has notified trading members that further securities issued by four companies under their Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOP) and Employee Stock Option Schemes (ESOS) will be listed and admitted for trading effective Monday, October 13, 2025. The companies involved are Sai Life Sciences Limited, Transport Corporation of India Ltd, UTI Asset Management Company Limited, and Wipro Ltd. None of the newly listed shares are under lock-in restrictions.

## Key Points

- Total of 268,564 new equity shares being listed across four companies

- Transport Corporation of India Ltd: 29,630 shares (Face Value: ₹2)

- Wipro Ltd: 44,401 shares (Face Value: ₹2)
- All shares have no lock-in period restrictions
- Trading to commence from October 13, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for shares issued under existing ESOP/ESOS frameworks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members are informed to update their systems for the new securities
- Companies must comply with standard listing requirements for ESOP/ESOS shares
- Unique ISIN codes assigned to each company for tracking the new shares

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Listing and Trading Commencement Date**: October 13, 2025 (Monday)

## Impact Assessment

The listing of these ESOP/ESOS shares represents routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The quantities being listed are small relative to the companies' existing market capitalization and trading volumes. For context, Wipro's 44,401 shares represent a negligible fraction of its approximately 11.69 billion outstanding shares. The absence of lock-in periods means these shares are immediately available for trading, though the impact on liquidity and price is expected to be minimal given the small volumes involved. This benefits employees who can immediately monetize their stock options without restrictions.
