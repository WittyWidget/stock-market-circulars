title: New ISIN Number for A B INFRABUILD LIMITED - Sub-Division of Equity Shares
---

## Summary

BSE has announced a new ISIN number for A B INFRABUILD LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544281) following the sub-division of equity shares. The company's equity shares have been sub-divided from a face value of Rs.10/- to Re.1/-, resulting in the assignment of a new ISIN number INE00YB01025. This change is a continuation of the Exchange Notice No. 20251007-57 dated October 07, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: A B INFRABUILD LIMITED (Scrip Code: 544281)
- New ISIN Number: INE00YB01025
- Corporate Action: Sub-division of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Re.1/-
- New face value: Re.1/- per equity share
- Notice Number: 20251015-40
- Reference: DR-738/2025-2026
- Issued by: Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President â€“ Listing Operations (CRD)

## Regulatory Changes

The sub-division of equity shares represents a capital restructuring where each existing equity share of face value Rs.10/- will be split into 10 equity shares of face value Re.1/- each. This requires the assignment of a new ISIN number to distinguish the new denomination shares from the old ones.

## Compliance Requirements

Trading Members of the Exchange must:
- Update their systems with the new ISIN number INE00YB01025 for A B INFRABUILD LIMITED
- Ensure all trades executed on or after the ex-date use the new ISIN number
- Maintain records distinguishing between old and new ISIN for shares traded before and after the ex-date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 15, 2025
- **Ex-Date:** October 17, 2025 (effective date for new ISIN)
- **Reference Notice:** October 07, 2025 (Exchange Notice No. 20251007-57)

The new ISIN number for equity shares of Re.1/- each shall be effective for all trades executed on and from October 17, 2025.

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The sub-division of shares increases the number of outstanding shares by a factor of 10 while reducing the per-share price proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members must update their systems before the ex-date to ensure seamless trading. Shareholders will see their holdings automatically adjusted to reflect the new face value and increased quantity.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares of Re.1/- face value for every 1 share of Rs.10/- face value held. The total investment value remains unchanged, only the denomination changes.
