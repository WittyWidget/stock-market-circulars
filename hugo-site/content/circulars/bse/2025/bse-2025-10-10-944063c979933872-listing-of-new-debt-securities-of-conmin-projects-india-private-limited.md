## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Minimal. This is a routine listing of privately placed debt securities from a private limited company with no equity listing. The securities have a relatively low credit rating (CARE B Stable) indicating higher risk, limiting broad market participation.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members can now trade these securities on BSE Debt segment. The high face value (Rs. 1 lakh per unit) and market lot of 1 suggests these are targeted at institutional or high-net-worth investors rather than retail participants.

**Investor Impact**: Limited to investors in private placement. The 17.25% coupon rate reflects the lower credit rating and higher risk profile of the issuer.
