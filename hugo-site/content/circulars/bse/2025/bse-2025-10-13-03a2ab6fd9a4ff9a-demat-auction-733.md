## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Routine auction settlements are normal market operations but can result in price volatility for the specific securities being auctioned, particularly those with large quantities.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - Affects brokers and clients who have failed to deliver securities in the regular settlement. They will need to either deliver the securities or purchase them at auction prices, which may be at a premium.

**Financial Impact**: Varies by scrip - Clients/brokers with delivery failures will incur auction costs and potential penalties. The impact is proportional to the quantity and value of securities involved.
