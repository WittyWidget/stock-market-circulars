## Impact Assessment

The listing of Valplast Technologies Limited adds a new company to BSE's equity market. The staggered lock-in structure across multiple time periods (1 month to 3 years) indicates different investor categories including promoters, strategic investors, and anchor investors. The significant proportion of shares under long-term lock-in (3,940,000 shares for 3 years and 4,280,000 shares for 2 years) suggests strong promoter holding and commitment. The relatively short lock-in period for anchor investors (1-3 months) follows SEBI guidelines. Trading liquidity will gradually increase as lock-in periods expire, with the first significant unlock occurring in October 2026 when approximately 7.9 million shares become freely tradeable.
