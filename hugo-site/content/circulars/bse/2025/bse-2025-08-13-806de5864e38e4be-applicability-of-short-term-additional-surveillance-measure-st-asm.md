## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective August 14, 2025. The circular provides three main updates: securities newly shortlisted for ST-ASM, securities continuing in the framework with stage changes, and securities moving out of the framework.

- 1 security moving to higher stage ASM while continuing in ST-ASM
- 7 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework
- Framework includes Stage I and Stage II classifications
- Special markings for SME scrips (@) and T+0 scrips (~)
- Some securities moving out due to inclusion in other frameworks (LT-ASM, Trade for Trade, GSM, Pledge, ESM)

## Regulatory Changes

- Enhanced surveillance measures applied to volatile securities
- Stage-based classification system for different levels of surveillance
- Consolidated monitoring approach across multiple surveillance frameworks

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with ST-ASM trading restrictions for listed securities
- Enhanced margin requirements and position limits may apply
- Special settlement and delivery requirements for securities under surveillance
- Continuous monitoring of price movements and trading patterns

## Important Dates

- **August 14, 2025**: Effective date for all ST-ASM framework changes
