## Impact Assessment

This bonus issue will double the number of outstanding shares of HDFC Bank, one of India's largest private sector banks. The 1:1 ratio means existing shareholders will see their shareholding quantity double while the share price will theoretically adjust to half. This corporate action will increase liquidity in the stock and make shares more accessible to retail investors due to lower absolute price per share post-bonus.
