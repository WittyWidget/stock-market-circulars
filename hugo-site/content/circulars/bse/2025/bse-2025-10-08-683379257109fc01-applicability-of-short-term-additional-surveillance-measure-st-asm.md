## Compliance Requirements

- Trading in these securities may be subject to additional surveillance and restrictions
- Investors should exercise caution when trading in ST-ASM securities
- Brokers and trading members must ensure compliance with ST-ASM framework requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 09, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The addition of 6 securities to ST-ASM framework indicates heightened surveillance on these scrips due to unusual trading patterns. This may lead to reduced liquidity and increased volatility in affected securities.

**Investor Impact:** Investors holding or trading in the newly added securities should be aware of potential trading restrictions and increased monitoring. Securities moving out of ST-ASM framework (moving to other frameworks like ESM or LT-ASM) may face different types of restrictions.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and brokers need to update their systems to reflect the new ST-ASM classifications and ensure appropriate risk management measures are in place for affected securities.
