## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal. The total number of shares being listed (298,994) represents a routine dilution across seven companies as part of their employee compensation programs. EPL Limited has the largest issuance at 128,017 shares, followed by Thyrocare Technologies with 59,450 shares.

**Liquidity Impact:** Negligible impact on overall liquidity given the relatively small number of shares compared to the existing float of these companies.

**Corporate Governance:** Positive indicator of companies implementing employee stock option plans to align employee interests with shareholder value.

**Trading Implications:** No special trading restrictions or lock-in periods apply, allowing immediate liquidity for option holders who have exercised their ESOPs/ESOS.
