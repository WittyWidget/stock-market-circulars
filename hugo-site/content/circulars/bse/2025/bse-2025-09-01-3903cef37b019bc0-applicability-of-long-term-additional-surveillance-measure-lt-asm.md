title: Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework Updates
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective September 2, 2025. The circular lists securities being newly included in LT-ASM, those moving between ASM stages, and provides a consolidated list of all securities under various ASM stages.

## Key Points

- 7 new securities added to Long Term ASM Framework (Stage I)
- 1 security (Ambo Agritec Ltd) moved from Stage I to Stage II
- No securities moved to lower ASM stages or direct Stage IV
- No securities moved out of LT-ASM framework
- Consolidated list shows securities across different ASM stages

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of enhanced surveillance measures for identified securities
- Stage-wise classification system for different levels of surveillance
- Automatic progression between stages based on performance criteria

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with LT-ASM framework requirements
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting for affected securities
- Adherence to specific trading conditions for securities under surveillance

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: September 2, 2025
- All changes to ASM classifications take effect from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

- Securities under LT-ASM face enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions
- Investors may experience different settlement cycles and margin requirements
- Market makers and arbitrageurs may face operational constraints for affected securities
- Stage progression indicates continued regulatory concern about price volatility or corporate governance issues
