## Summary

BSE has issued a circular announcing the listing of equity shares of Swastika Castal Limited. The circular provides detailed information about 8.164 million shares with various lock-in periods ranging from 2026 to 2028, along with 2.164 million free shares under IPO allocation.

## Key Points

- Total shares listed: 8,164,000 equity shares
- All shares are fully paid and in demat form
- Multiple tranches with different lock-in periods (2026, 2027, and 2028)
- 2,164,000 shares are free shares under IPO with no lock-in restrictions
- Lock-in periods end on August 9th of respective years (2026, 2027, 2028)

## Regulatory Changes

No specific regulatory changes are mentioned in this circular. This is a standard listing notification following existing BSE listing procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Company must maintain compliance with BSE listing regulations
- Lock-in restrictions must be enforced until specified dates
- All shares must remain in demat form as specified
- Company must adhere to disclosure requirements for locked-in securities

## Important Dates

- Lock-in expiry dates:
  - August 9, 2026: Multiple tranches totaling 1,128,800 shares
  - August 9, 2027: Multiple tranches totaling 2,871,200 shares  
  - August 9, 2028: 1,635,000 shares
- Free shares (2,164,000) have no lock-in restrictions and are immediately tradeable

## Impact Assessment

The listing introduces a new equity instrument to BSE with significant lock-in components (approximately 73% of total shares are locked-in). This creates limited immediate liquidity with only 2.164 million shares freely tradeable. The staggered lock-in release schedule over 2026-2028 will gradually increase available float, potentially impacting share price volatility and trading volumes as restrictions lift.
