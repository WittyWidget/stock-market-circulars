## Summary

BSE has announced that the delisting of Birla Capital & Financial Services Ltd (Scrip Code: 512332) has been rescinded pursuant to an order issued by the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal. The company's status will be changed from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective October 28, 2025. As a consequence of this status change, the provisions of Regulation 24(1) and Regulation 24(2) of SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009 are no longer applicable to the company.

## Key Points

- Delisting of Birla Capital & Financial Services Ltd has been rescinded by Securities Appellate Tribunal order
- Company scrip code: 512332
- Status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended" effective October 28, 2025
- SEBI Delisting Regulations 24(1) and 24(2) provisions no longer applicable
- Notice issued by BSE Listing Compliance on October 24, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

The rescission of delisting order removes the applicability of specific provisions under SEBI (Delisting of Equity Shares) Regulations, 2009:
- Regulation 24(1) - provisions no longer applicable
- Regulation 24(2) - provisions no longer applicable

The company will now be governed by regulations applicable to suspended companies rather than delisted entities.

## Compliance Requirements

- BSE will implement the status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended" in its systems
- The company will need to comply with requirements applicable to suspended companies
- Trading members and market participants should note the changed status for the scrip
- The company remains subject to BSE listing compliance requirements applicable to suspended securities

## Important Dates

- **October 24, 2025**: Notice issued by BSE
- **October 28, 2025**: Effective date for status change from "Delisted" to "Suspended"

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: This is a rare instance of delisting being rescinded by the Securities Appellate Tribunal, representing a significant regulatory development. While the status changes to "Suspended" rather than returning to normal trading, it provides a potential pathway for the company to eventually resume trading if compliance requirements are met.

**Company Impact**: Birla Capital & Financial Services Ltd gains relief from certain delisting regulation provisions, though the suspended status still restricts trading. The company may now pursue steps to lift the suspension and restore normal trading status.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders benefit from the delisting rescission, as it preserves the listing status and potential future liquidity. However, shares remain untradeable during the suspended status period.

**Regulatory Significance**: The tribunal order demonstrates judicial oversight of delisting decisions and provides precedent for companies seeking relief from delisting orders through appellate mechanisms.
