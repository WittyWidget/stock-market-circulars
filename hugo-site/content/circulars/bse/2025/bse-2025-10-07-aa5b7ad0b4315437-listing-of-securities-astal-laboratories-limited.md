## Impact Assessment

This is a routine listing announcement with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment represents warrant conversion, adding approximately 940,000 shares to the trading float. However, all shares are locked-in for approximately 6.5 months (until April 30, 2026), preventing immediate trading or sale by allottees. The dilution impact depends on existing share capital but the lock-in period provides stability. Trading members should note the lock-in restrictions when processing client orders.
