title: Enhancement in Market Data Streams â€“ Update with Parallel Run Implementation
---

## Summary

BSE announces a phased approach for implementing enhanced market data streams, providing parallel support for existing NFCAST format alongside new format for a limited period. The rollout extends from September 8 to October 13, 2025, with different go-live dates for each segment.

## Key Points

- Parallel run of existing and new NFCAST format for limited period based on member feedback
- EOBI/EMDI/MDI streams will switch directly to new format without parallel support
- New multicast IP and port assignments for enhanced data streams
- Mock trading sessions scheduled before each segment go-live
- Different implementation timeline for each trading segment

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation of enhanced market data stream formats across all trading segments
- New multicast IP and port configurations for improved data delivery
- Phased migration approach replacing direct switchover originally planned

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must update systems to support new data stream formats
- Third-party trading application vendors must undertake necessary system development
- Migration from existing to new NFCAST format must be completed before discontinuation dates
- Testing participation in mock trading sessions recommended

## Important Dates

- **September 6, 2025**: Mock trading for Currency Derivatives, Commodities Derivatives & EGR
- **September 8, 2025**: Go-live for Currency Derivatives, Commodities Derivatives & EGR (new format)
- **September 13, 2025**: Mock trading for Equity Derivatives
- **September 15, 2025**: Go-live for Equity Derivatives (new format)
- **September 20, 2025**: Mock trading for Equity segment
- **September 22, 2025**: Go-live for Equity segment (new format)
- **October 3, 2025**: Last day of parallel NFCAST for Currency/Commodities Derivatives & EGR
- **October 6, 2025**: Discontinuation of existing NFCAST format for Currency/Commodities Derivatives & EGR
- **October 10, 2025**: Last day of parallel NFCAST for Equity segment
- **October 13, 2025**: Discontinuation of existing NFCAST format for Equity segment

## Impact Assessment

- **High operational impact** on all trading members and technology vendors requiring system updates
- **Reduced disruption risk** through parallel run approach compared to direct switchover
- **Enhanced market data delivery** capabilities once fully implemented
- **Technology infrastructure upgrade** affecting real-time trading operations
- **Member preparation time** extended through phased implementation and mock sessions
