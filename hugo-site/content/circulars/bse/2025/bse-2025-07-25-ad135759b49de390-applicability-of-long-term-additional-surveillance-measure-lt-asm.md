title: Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Updates - July 28, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced updates to the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) framework effective July 28, 2025. The update includes 4 new securities entering the framework, 24 securities exiting the framework, and 4 securities being moved to different ASM stages. Many securities exiting the framework are being moved to the Trade for Trade segment.

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted for Long Term ASM Framework
- 24 securities moving out of Long Term ASM Framework
- 4 securities continuing in framework but moving to different ASM stages
- No securities moving to Direct Stage IV Long Term ASM
- Several securities exiting due to inclusion in Trade for Trade framework

## Regulatory Changes

**New Entries to LT-ASM (Part A):**
- Aryan Share and Stock Brokers Ltd (542176)
- Diana Tea Company Ltd (530959)
- Force Motors Ltd (500033) - as per NSE
- Remi Edelstahl Tubulars Ltd (513043)

**Securities Moving to Lower ASM Stages (Part C):**
- Ashika Credit Capital Ltd - moved to Stage III
- Banganga Paper Industries Ltd - moved to Stage I
- Vadilal Enterprises Ltd - moved to Stage III
- Yash Highvoltage Ltd - moved to Stage I

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must adjust trading strategies for securities entering LT-ASM framework
- Enhanced surveillance measures will apply to newly included securities
- Securities moving out of framework will have relaxed surveillance conditions
- Trade for Trade restrictions will apply to securities marked with asterisk (*)

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** July 28, 2025
- All changes to surveillance measures become applicable from this date

## Impact Assessment

The update represents a balanced approach with equal numbers of securities entering and exiting various surveillance categories. The movement of 24 securities out of LT-ASM framework, particularly those moving to Trade for Trade segment, may improve liquidity for those stocks while maintaining necessary oversight. The addition of 4 new securities to the framework indicates continued vigilance over market quality and investor protection.
