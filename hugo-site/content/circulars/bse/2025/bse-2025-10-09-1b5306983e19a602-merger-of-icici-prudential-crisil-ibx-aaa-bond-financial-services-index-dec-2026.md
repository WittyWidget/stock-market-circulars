## Impact Assessment

**Rationale for Merger:**

The merger is driven by market conditions and declining scheme viability:

1. **Interest Rate Environment**: RBI implemented significant monetary policy changes in 2025:
   - February 2025: Substantial liquidity injection and enhanced bond purchases to address interbank cash shortages
   - Rate cuts totaling 100 basis points: 25 bps in February, 25 bps in April, and 50 bps in June 2025
   - These measures pushed bond yields lower

2. **Impact on Merging Scheme**:
   - Change in interest rate cycle reduced investor interest in Debt Index Funds
   - Sustained redemptions led to continuous outflows and declining AUM
   - Lower AUM makes it challenging to replicate the underlying index in accordance with regulatory guidelines
   - Difficulty in maintaining tracking difference requirements

3. **Scheme Characteristics**:
   - Merging Scheme: Open-ended target maturity index fund investing >95% in AAA rated bonds of Financial Services Companies maturing on or before December 2026
   - Surviving Scheme: Has flexibility to invest across various debt and money market instruments including bonds and debentures

**Impact on Unitholders:**
- Unitholders of the Merging Scheme will become unitholders of the Surviving Scheme
- The Surviving Scheme offers broader investment flexibility compared to the target maturity index fund
- No change in fundamental attributes of the Surviving Scheme, so existing unitholders of the Surviving Scheme are not adversely affected
