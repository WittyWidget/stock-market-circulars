title: Surveillance Action on Unsolicited Videos and Messages in Social Media - August
  2025 Update
---

## Summary

BSE has updated its surveillance action list for securities where unsolicited promotional videos and messages have been circulated on social media platforms. The update removes Kairosoft AI Solutions Ltd from surveillance while maintaining Murae Organisor Ltd under monitoring effective August 6, 2025.

## Key Points

- No new securities added to surveillance list for unsolicited social media promotion
- Kairosoft AI Solutions Ltd (Scrip Code: 506122, ISIN: INE820M01018) removed from surveillance
- Murae Organisor Ltd (Scrip Code: 542724, ISIN: INE060601023) remains under surveillance
- Update effective from August 6, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory framework changes introduced. This is a routine update to the existing surveillance mechanism for securities subject to unsolicited social media promotion.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants should be aware of securities under surveillance for unsolicited promotion
- Investors advised to exercise caution when dealing with securities that have been subject to unsolicited promotional activities
- Enhanced monitoring continues for remaining securities on the consolidated list

## Important Dates

- **August 6, 2025**: Effective date for the updated surveillance list

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as this represents routine surveillance maintenance. The removal of one security from surveillance indicates improved compliance or cessation of problematic promotional activities. Continued monitoring of Murae Organisor Ltd suggests ongoing concerns about unsolicited promotional content for this security.
