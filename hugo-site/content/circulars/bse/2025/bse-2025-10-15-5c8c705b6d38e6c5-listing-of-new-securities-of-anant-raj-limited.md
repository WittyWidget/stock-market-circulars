**Market Impact**: The listing of a significant block of shares may impact short-term liquidity and price discovery. The issue price of Rs. 662 provides a reference point for market valuation. QIP allotments typically go to institutional investors with longer investment horizons, which may provide stability.

**Trading Impact**: Increased float from October 16, 2025, may enhance liquidity in the stock. The distinctive number range allows for clear identification of QIP shares for settlement purposes.

**Company Impact**: The capital raised through QIP will strengthen the company's financial position and can be utilized for business expansion, debt reduction, or other corporate purposes as disclosed in the placement document.
