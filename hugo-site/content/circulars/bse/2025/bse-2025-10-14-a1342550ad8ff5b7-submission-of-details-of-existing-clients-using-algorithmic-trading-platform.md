## Impact Assessment

This requirement affects all trading members offering algorithmic trading platforms to retail clients. Members must have systems in place to track and categorize client algorithmic trading activities by strategy type (white box vs. black box) and product type. The data collection will help SEBI and exchanges monitor retail participation in algorithmic trading and ensure appropriate safeguards are in place. Trading members should allocate resources to compile this information accurately before the deadline.
