## Summary

BSE has issued a circular mandating SEBI registered intermediaries to adopt standardised, validated, and exclusive UPI IDs for collecting payments from investors. This initiative aims to enhance transparency, security, and accountability in payment collection processes and reduce instances of fraudulent transactions.

## Key Points
