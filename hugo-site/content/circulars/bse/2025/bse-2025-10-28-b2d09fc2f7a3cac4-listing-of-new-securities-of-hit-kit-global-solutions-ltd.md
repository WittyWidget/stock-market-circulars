## Compliance Requirements

- Lock-in restrictions must be observed as specified

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** July 21, 2025
- **Trading Commencement Date:** October 29, 2025
- **Lock-in Period Ends:** June 30, 2025 (Note: This appears to be a date error in the original circular as the lock-in end date precedes the allotment date)

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The listing involves a relatively small number of shares (5,00,000) for a single company. The preferential allotment increases the company's equity base but represents standard corporate financing activity. Trading members should update their systems to reflect the new distinctive numbers and lock-in restrictions. The impact is limited to investors and trading members dealing with Hit Kit Global Solutions Ltd securities.
