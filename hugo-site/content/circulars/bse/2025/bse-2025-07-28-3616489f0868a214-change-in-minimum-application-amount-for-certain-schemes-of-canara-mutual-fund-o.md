## Summary

Canara Robeco Asset Management has announced substantial reductions in minimum application amounts for their Large Cap Fund (formerly Blue Chip Equity Fund) across all transaction types. The changes make the fund more accessible to retail investors by reducing entry barriers from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 100 for lump sum investments.

## Key Points

- Lump sum investment minimum reduced from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 100
- Additional purchase minimum reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100
- Minimum redemption/switch-out reduced from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100
- STP minimum amounts standardized to Rs. 100 across all frequencies (Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly)
- SWP minimum amounts unified to Rs. 100 for Monthly/Quarterly/Annual frequencies
- Changes effective from July 28, 2025

## Regulatory Changes

This is an operational change by the fund house to improve accessibility. The revision updates the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM) with new minimum application amounts across different investment modes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Fund house to update all scheme documentation
- BSE StAR MF platform to implement new minimum amounts
- Distributors and investors to be notified of revised limits

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: July 28, 2025
- **Notice Date**: July 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The significant reduction in minimum amounts (from Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 100 for lump sum) democratizes access to the Large Cap Fund, potentially attracting more retail investors. This move aligns with industry trends toward lower entry barriers and could increase the fund's asset base through broader participation.
