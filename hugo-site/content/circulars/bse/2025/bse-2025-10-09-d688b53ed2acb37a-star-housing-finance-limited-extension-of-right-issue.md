The opening date has been postponed from October 10, 2025, to October 27, 2025, and the closing date from October 31, 2025, to November 3, 2025.

## Compliance Requirements

- Shareholders interested in the Rights Issue should note the revised timeline

## Important Dates

| Event | Earlier Date | Revised Date |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Rights Issue Opening Date | Friday, October 10, 2025 | Monday, October 27, 2025 |
| Last Date for On-Market Renunciation of Rights Entitlement | Monday, October 27, 2025 | Tuesday, October 28, 2025 |
| Rights Issue Closing Date | Friday, October 31, 2025 | Monday, November 3, 2025 |

## Impact Assessment

**Impact on Shareholders:** Existing shareholders planning to participate in the Rights Issue now have additional time to arrange funds and make decisions. Those planning to renounce rights should note the one-day extension for on-market renunciation.

**Market Impact:** Limited direct market impact as this is a timeline adjustment rather than a change in terms. However, the delay may indicate operational or regulatory complexities that required additional time for resolution.

**Operational Considerations:** The 17-day postponement of the opening date suggests the company needed more time for regulatory approvals, documentation finalization, or logistical arrangements. The extension ensures proper compliance and execution quality over speed.
