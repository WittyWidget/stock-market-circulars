title: Price Band Revisions for 14 Securities Effective September 05, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has revised price bands for 14 securities effective September 5, 2025. The revised bands range from 2% to 20%, with most securities having restrictive bands between 2-10%. This surveillance measure aims to control excessive price volatility in these stocks.

## Key Points

- 14 securities affected with revised price bands
- Effective date: September 5, 2025
- Price bands range from 2% (most restrictive) to 20% (least restrictive)
- A2Z Infra, Indiabulls Enterprises, Indokem, SVS Ventures, and Umiya Tubes get 2% bands
- Sarveshwar Foods gets the highest band at 20%
- Most securities (7 out of 14) receive bands of 5% or 10%

## Regulatory Changes

Price band percentages have been revised from existing levels for the listed securities. This represents a surveillance action to manage price volatility and trading risks.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must implement new price bands from September 5, 2025
- All equity trading in these securities must comply with revised percentage limits
- Queries should be directed to bse.surv@bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **September 4, 2025**: Circular issued
- **September 5, 2025**: Revised price bands become effective

## Impact Assessment

The price band revisions will limit intraday price movements for these 14 securities, potentially reducing volatility but also limiting trading opportunities. Securities with 2% bands face the most restrictive trading environment, while those with higher bands maintain more flexibility. This measure indicates heightened surveillance concern for these stocks.
