title: Corporate Actions in SLB Securities - September 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced corporate actions for 22 securities in the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) segment for September 2025. The majority are dividend declarations with record dates ranging from September 5-23, 2025, while one company (Bajaj Consumer Care) has announced a share buyback.

## Key Points

- 21 companies declaring dividends with various record dates in September 2025
- 1 company (Bajaj Consumer Care) conducting share buyback with record date September 5, 2025
- All corporate actions will affect SLB market operations during specified shut periods
- Ex-dates mostly align with record dates, with some variations
- Shut periods range from 2-4 days for each corporate action

## Impact Assessment

The corporate actions will temporarily restrict SLB operations for the affected securities during their respective shut periods. Market participants need to plan their SLB positions accordingly, especially for high-volume securities like RBL Bank, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders. The concentration of dividend payments in mid-September may create liquidity constraints in the SLB market during that period.

## Compliance Requirements

- SLB market participants must observe shut periods for affected securities
- No new SLB transactions can be initiated during shut periods
- Existing positions may be affected by the corporate actions
- Market participants should adjust their strategies for securities going ex-dividend
