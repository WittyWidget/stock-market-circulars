## Compliance Requirements

- Lock-in period compliance until February 28, 2026
- Standard trading and settlement procedures apply

- **Allotment Date:** March 2, 2024
- **Trading Commencement:** August 20, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Significant equity dilution of approximately 35 lakh shares increases the company's equity base substantially. The preferential allotment to non-promoters may impact ownership structure and voting dynamics. Two-year lock-in period provides some stability but creates potential overhang when restrictions expire in February 2026.
