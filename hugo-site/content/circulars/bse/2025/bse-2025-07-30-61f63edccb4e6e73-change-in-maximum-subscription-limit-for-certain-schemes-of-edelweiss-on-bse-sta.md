## Summary

Edelweiss Asset Management Limited has increased the maximum subscription limit for its Greater China Equity Off-shore Fund from INR 10 lakh to INR 25 lakh per PAN per day, effective July 31, 2025. This change is based on available headroom for overseas investment limits and applies to all subscription types including lumpsum, SIP, and STPs.

## Key Points

- Subscription limit increased from INR 10 lakh to INR 25 lakh per PAN per day
- Applies only to Edelweiss Greater China Equity Off-shore Fund
- All other offshore funds maintain INR 10 lakh per PAN per day limit
- Existing systematic transactions (SIPs/STPs) remain unaffected
- Based on overseas investment headroom available as of February 1, 2022

## Regulatory Changes

The change follows SEBI clarification dated June 17, 2022 (SEBI/HO/OW/IMD-II/DOF3/25095/2022) allowing mutual funds to resume subscriptions up to available headroom without breaching overseas investment limits.

## Compliance Requirements

- Revised limit applies based on transaction reporting date
- Transactions reported till July 30, 2025 before cut-off time will not be subject to new limit
- SID/KIM documents will be updated to reflect changes
- Notice forms integral part of scheme documents

## Important Dates

- **July 31, 2025**: New subscription limit becomes effective
- **July 30, 2025**: Cut-off date for transactions under old limit
- **April 09, 2025**: Previous notice-cum-addendum date

## Impact Assessment

Positive impact for investors seeking higher exposure to Greater China equity markets through increased daily investment capacity. Limited to one specific offshore scheme, maintaining controlled exposure to overseas investments while providing enhanced access for qualified investors.
