## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) of Grand Hills Developments Private Limited effective October 30, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date for early redemption of its debentures. Trading members are advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the no-dealings date.

- Debenture series: GHPL-11.70%-RR-7-3-26-PVT
- Record date set for October 30, 2025
- No dealings permitted from October 30, 2025
- Reason: Early redemption of NCDs
- Notice reference: DR-746/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard corporate action notification for early redemption of debentures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must not execute any trades in the specified debentures from October 30, 2025
- Members must ensure compliance with the no-dealings restriction
- Any pending orders or positions should be squared off before the suspension date

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date:** October 27, 2025
- **Record Date:** October 30, 2025
- **No Dealings From:** October 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The impact is limited to holders and traders of this specific NCD series of Grand Hills Developments Private Limited. As this is a private limited company with a single debenture series affected, the overall market impact is minimal. The early redemption provides liquidity to debenture holders but removes this instrument from trading. Trading members with positions in this security should take note and plan accordingly before the suspension date.
