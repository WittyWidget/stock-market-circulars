## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Medium - The share sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 5x while reducing the trading price proportionately. This typically improves liquidity and makes shares more accessible to retail investors. The new lower price per share may attract increased trading interest.

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and market participants must update their systems to reflect the new ISIN. Existing shareholders will see their holdings multiplied by 5 with proportionate reduction in price per share. All pending orders, if any, may need to be adjusted for the new face value.

**Investor Impact:** Existing shareholders will receive 5 shares of Rs.2/- face value for every 1 share of Rs.10/- face value held. The total investment value remains unchanged, but the number of shares increases.
