## Compliance Requirements

Trading members must note that all trading in these debentures will be conducted at the reduced face value of Rs. 80,000 per debenture from the effective date. Members should update their systems and inform clients accordingly.

This is a standard corporate action that provides return of capital to investors while maintaining the debt instrument in circulation.
