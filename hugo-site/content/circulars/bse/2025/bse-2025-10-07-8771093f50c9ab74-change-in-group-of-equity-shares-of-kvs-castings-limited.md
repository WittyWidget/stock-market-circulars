## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: The transition from Trade for Trade to Rolling settlement is typically positive for liquidity and trading activity. T2T segments are restrictive and often applied to stocks with concerns about delivery or speculative activity. Moving to Rolling settlement indicates improved market confidence and normalizing trading conditions.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members will experience enhanced flexibility in trading KVS Castings Limited shares. The removal from T2T restrictions allows for intraday trading, margin trading facilities, and standard settlement cycles, which typically increases trading volumes and liquidity.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will benefit from improved liquidity and easier entry/exit options. The change signals a maturation phase for this SME IPO stock, potentially attracting broader investor participation.
