BSE has issued a new ISIN number INE133B01027 for KESAR ENTERPRISES LTD (Scrip Code: 507180) following the subdivision of equity shares from Rs.10/- to Re.1/-. This change continues the process initiated in Exchange Notice No. 20250901-10 dated September 01, 2025.

## Key Points

- Company: KESAR ENTERPRISES LTD (Scrip Code: 507180)
- New ISIN Number: INE133B01027
- Share subdivision: From Rs.10/- to Re.1/- per equity share
- Effective date: September 18, 2025 (Ex-Date)
- Document reference: DR-718/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

The new ISIN number replaces the previous identifier for all equity shares of Re.1/- each following the approved share subdivision process.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN number for all trades from the ex-date
- System updates required to reflect the new share denomination and ISIN
- Existing shareholders will receive subdivided shares in the new denomination

## Important Dates

- **Ex-Date**: September 18, 2025 - New ISIN becomes effective for trading
- **Original Notice Date**: September 01, 2025
- **Current Notice Date**: September 10, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This share subdivision will increase the number of shares outstanding by a factor of 10 while reducing the face value proportionally. The change should improve liquidity and make shares more accessible to retail investors due to lower absolute price per share. Trading systems and portfolios will need updates to reflect the new ISIN and share structure.
