## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. The listing adds 2,400,000 shares to Kilburn Engineering Ltd's equity capital. However, immediate market impact is minimal as all newly listed shares are locked-in until May 30, 2026, preventing trading or transfer during this period.

The preferential allotment to non-promoters represents capital raising through warrant conversion, which is a routine corporate action.
