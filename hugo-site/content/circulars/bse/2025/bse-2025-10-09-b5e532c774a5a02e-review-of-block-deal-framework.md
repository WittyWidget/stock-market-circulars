## Summary

SEBI has issued Circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/POD-III/CIR/P/2025/134 dated October 08, 2025, comprehensively reviewing and modifying the Block Deal Framework. The revised framework introduces two distinct trading windows - a morning window (8:45 AM to 9:00 AM) and an afternoon window (2:05 PM to 2:20 PM) - with specific reference pricing mechanisms for each. The minimum order size has been set at INR 25 crores, and all trades must result in delivery without squaring off or reversal.

## Key Points

- Two separate block deal windows established: Morning (8:45 AM - 9:00 AM) and Afternoon (2:05 PM - 2:20 PM)
- Morning window uses previous day's closing price as reference; Afternoon window uses VWAP calculated from 1:45 PM to 2:00 PM
- Price range restricted to ±3% of applicable reference price in respective windows
- Minimum order size of INR 25 crores mandatory for all block deals
- All trades must result in delivery and cannot be squared off or reversed
- Stock exchanges can set trading hours between 8:45 AM to 5:00 PM
- Information on block deals (scrip name, client name, quantity, price) must be disseminated after market hours on the same day
- Provisions apply to both T+1 and optional T+0 settlement cycles

- Enhanced surveillance requirements to monitor compliance with ±3% price bands
- Mandatory disclosure requirements increase transparency but may affect trading strategies

**Settlement Impact:**
- Delivery-only trades eliminate speculative block deals
- Provisions extend to both T+1 and T+0 settlement cycles
- No reversal or squaring off increases settlement certainty

**Investor Impact:**

- Limited to large institutional investors due to INR 25 crore threshold
