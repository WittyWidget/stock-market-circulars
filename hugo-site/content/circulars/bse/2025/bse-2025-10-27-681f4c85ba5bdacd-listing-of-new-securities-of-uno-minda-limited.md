## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected. This is a routine corporate action involving listing of shares from an amalgamation scheme. The number of shares (281,974) represents a relatively small addition to UNO Minda's existing equity base. The amalgamation consolidates related Kosei Minda entities into the parent company, which is a corporate restructuring activity with no immediate trading or operational implications for market participants.
