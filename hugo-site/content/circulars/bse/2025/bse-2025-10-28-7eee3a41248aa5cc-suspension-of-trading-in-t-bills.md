## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in a specific 182-day Treasury Bill (T-bill) with effect from October 29, 2025. The suspension is due to the T-bill's scheduled redemption/maturity date of October 31, 2025. Trading members are advised not to deal in this security starting two days before maturity.

## Key Points

- T-bill with ISIN IN002025Y057 (182T311025) will mature on October 31, 2025
- Trading suspension effective from October 29, 2025
- Scrip Code: 805059
- Notice issued under reference number DR-745/2025-2026
- Standard pre-maturity trading suspension procedure

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is a routine operational notice for pre-maturity trading suspension.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all trading activities in the mentioned T-bill from October 29, 2025
- Members should ensure no transactions are executed for ISIN IN002025Y057 after the suspension date
- Members must update their trading systems to reflect the suspension

## Important Dates

- **October 28, 2025**: Notice issued
- **October 29, 2025**: Trading suspension becomes effective
- **October 31, 2025**: T-bill redemption/maturity date

## Impact Assessment

This is a routine operational notice with minimal market impact. The suspension affects only a single T-bill instrument approaching maturity. Trading members holding positions in this T-bill should have already planned for redemption. No broader market implications as this is standard practice for maturing debt instruments. Investors holding the T-bill will receive redemption proceeds on the maturity date through standard settlement procedures.
