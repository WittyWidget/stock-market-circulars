## Summary

BSE has updated its Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective August 22, 2025. The exchange is placing 14 securities under ST-ASM Stage I framework while removing 7 securities from the surveillance measures.

- 7 securities moving out of ST-ASM Framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower ASM stages
- Includes both regular and SME scrips
- T+0 scrips included based on parent company criteria

## Securities Added to ST-ASM Framework

**New inclusions (Stage I):**
- Alliance Integrated Metaliks Ltd (534064)
- Alphalogic Industries Ltd (543937) - SME scrip
- Baroda Extrusion Ltd (513502)
- Frontline Corporation Ltd (532042)

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** August 22, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The ST-ASM framework implementation will result in enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions for the 14 newly included securities. Securities moving out of the framework will have reduced surveillance measures, with some transitioning to other surveillance frameworks like ESM. The measure affects both regular equity securities and SME scrips, indicating broader market surveillance activity.
