- Enhanced monitoring across 5/15/30 day periods

- Potential progressive escalation to higher surveillance stages
- Additional disclosure and transparency requirements
- Possible trading restrictions based on stage level

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must be aware of securities under ST-ASM surveillance
- Enhanced due diligence recommended for trading in listed securities
- Brokers should ensure clients are informed about surveillance status
- Investors should exercise caution when trading ST-ASM securities
- Regular monitoring of stage changes and framework updates required

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 10, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable
- **Circular Date**: October 9, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The addition of 9 securities to ST-ASM surveillance indicates increased regulatory scrutiny on these stocks due to unusual trading patterns or price movements. Investors may experience:

- Reduced liquidity in affected securities
- Higher margin requirements potentially imposed
- Increased volatility awareness
- Enhanced risk perception

**Investor Impact**: Existing and potential investors in the 9 newly added securities should exercise heightened caution. The surveillance framework serves as an early warning system for abnormal market behavior.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members and participants need to update their systems and risk management frameworks to account for the surveillance measures applicable to these securities. The movement of Gayatri Sugars Ltd to LT-ASM indicates escalation to long-term surveillance, suggesting persistent concerns requiring extended monitoring.
