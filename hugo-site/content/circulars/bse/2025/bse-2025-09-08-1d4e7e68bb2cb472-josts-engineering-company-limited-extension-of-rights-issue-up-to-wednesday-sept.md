## Summary

Josts Engineering Company Limited (Scrip Code: 505750) has extended the closing date of its ongoing Rights Issue from Tuesday, September 9, 2025 to Wednesday, September 10, 2025. The extension was approved by the Rights Issue Committee on September 6, 2025, citing Monday September 8 being a bank holiday and multiple requests from eligible shareholders.

## Key Points

- Rights Issue closing date extended by one day to September 10, 2025
- Extension approved by Rights Issue Committee meeting on September 6, 2025
- Reason: Bank holiday on September 8 and shareholder requests for more time
- Issue originally opened on Friday, August 29, 2025
- All other terms and conditions remain unchanged except for revised timeline

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes - this is a procedural extension of an existing rights issue timeline.

## Compliance Requirements

- Eligible shareholders must submit duly filled CAF (Common Application Form) along with payment by Wednesday, September 10, 2025
- No changes to LOF (Letter of Offer), CAF, and ALOF (Abridged Letter of Offer) dated August 13, 2025 except closing date modification
- Updated indicative timetable for post-issue activities

## Important Dates

- **Issue Closing Date (Revised)**: Wednesday, September 10, 2025
- **Finalization of Basis of Allotment**: Thursday, September 18, 2025 (on or about)
- **Date of Allotment**: Friday, September 19, 2025 (on or about)
- **Date of Credit**: Tuesday, September 23, 2025 (on or about)
- **Date of Listing**: Wednesday, September 24, 2025 (on or about)

## Impact Assessment

The extension provides eligible shareholders with additional time to participate in the rights issue, potentially improving subscription rates. The one-day extension has minimal market impact but demonstrates company responsiveness to shareholder needs. The revised timeline pushes back all subsequent activities including allotment and listing by the corresponding period.
