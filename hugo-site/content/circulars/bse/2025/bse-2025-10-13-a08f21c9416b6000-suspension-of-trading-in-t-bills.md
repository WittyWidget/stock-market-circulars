- **Effective Date of Suspension:** October 14, 2025
- **Expected Maturity/Redemption Date:** October 16, 2025 (inferred from security codes)

## Impact Assessment

The suspension has limited market impact as it affects specific debt instruments nearing maturity. This is a standard operational procedure for maturing government securities. Investors holding these securities should prepare for redemption. No action required for investors in other securities. The suspension ensures orderly market operations and prevents trading in instruments about to mature.
