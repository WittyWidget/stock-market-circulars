- Company: CHANDRIMA MERCANTILES LTD (Scrip Code: 540829)
- Share subdivision: From Rs.10/- to Re.1/- per share
- Effective date: August 20, 2025 (Ex-Date)
- DR Number: 698/2025-2026

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must use the new ISIN number for trades from August 20, 2025 onwards
- All trading systems must be updated to reflect the new ISIN number
- Depository participants need to update records with new ISIN

## Important Dates

- **August 20, 2025**: Ex-date for new ISIN number to become effective
- **August 18, 2025**: Notice date
- **August 14, 2025**: Previous related notice (20250814-42)

## Impact Assessment

Medium operational impact requiring system updates by trading members and market participants. The 10:1 share subdivision will increase the number of shares outstanding while reducing the face value, making shares more affordable for retail investors. Trading operations need to transition to the new ISIN number from the ex-date.
