title: Trading and Settlement of Trades in Dematerialised Securities of RNIT AI Solutions
  Ltd.
---

## Summary

BSE notifies that RNIT AI Solutions Ltd. (scrip code: 517286) has signed agreements with both depositories, enabling compulsory dematerialised settlement of trades. The scrip will trade in the Trade to Trade segment with a market lot of 1 equity share, no netting allowed, and shortages will be directly closed out. These parameters will become applicable upon revocation of the current trading suspension.

## Key Points

- RNIT AI Solutions Ltd. (scrip code: 517286) has completed depository agreements
- Trades will be settled in compulsory demat form
- Scrip will trade in Trade to Trade segment for reasons other than non-signing of depository agreements
- Market lot is 1 equity share
- Netting is not allowed in the scrip
- Shortages will be directly closed out
- Trading currently remains under suspension
- New parameters will apply upon revocation of suspension

## Regulatory Changes

The scrip transitions from suspended status to Trade to Trade segment trading with mandatory demat settlement. This follows the company's completion of agreements with both NSDL and CDSL depositories.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must settle all trades in compulsory dematerialised form
- No physical settlement will be permitted
- Trading members must ensure compliance with Trade to Trade segment rules
- Netting of positions is prohibited
- All shortages must be closed out directly

## Important Dates

- Notice Date: October 23, 2025
- Effective Date: Upon revocation of suspension (as per Exchange Notice No. 20251014-24 dated October 14, 2025 and Notice No. 20251015-16 dated October 15, 2025)

## Impact Assessment

The circular has medium impact as it establishes the operational framework for future trading in RNIT AI Solutions Ltd. once the suspension is lifted. The Trade to Trade segment classification with compulsory demat settlement, prohibition of netting, and direct close-out of shortages will affect trading strategies and settlement processes. Trading members will need to adjust their systems and processes to accommodate the market lot of 1 share and the strict settlement requirements. The immediate market impact is limited due to the ongoing trading suspension.
