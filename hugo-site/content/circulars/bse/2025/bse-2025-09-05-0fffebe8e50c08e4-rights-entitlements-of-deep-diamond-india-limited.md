## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must inform clients about RE trading commencement and ISIN

- Clients must be informed that REs provide right to participate in Rights Issue or renounce before closure
- Warning that unsubscribed/unrenounced REs will lapse after Issue Closing Date

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact for existing Deep Diamond India Limited shareholders who can trade their rights entitlements. Trading members need to ensure proper client communication and disclaimer procedures. Limited broader market impact as this affects only one company's shareholders.
