  Industries Ltd.)
---

## Summary

BSE has announced the revocation of trading suspension for RNIT AI Solutions Ltd. (Scrip Code: 517286), formerly known as Autopal Industries Ltd., effective Thursday, October 16, 2025. This action follows an NCLT-approved resolution plan dated September 23, 2024, and ends a suspension that has been in place since March 28, 2016. The stock will be part of the Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) for IPOs and relisted scrips upon resumption of trading.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension revoked for RNIT AI Solutions Ltd. (formerly Autopal Industries Ltd.)
- Scrip Code: 517286
- Effective date: Thursday, October 16, 2025
- Suspension originally imposed via notice 20160328-15 dated March 28, 2016
- Revocation follows NCLT order dated September 23, 2024 approving resolution plan
- Stock will participate in Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) for IPOs and relisted scrips
- Trading members should refer to notice 20120216-29 for SPOS guidelines

## Regulatory Changes

The revocation of trading suspension represents the completion of the corporate insolvency resolution process under the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The approved resolution plan allows the company to resume normal trading operations on BSE. No new regulatory framework is introduced; the company returns to standard trading procedures with the special provision of SPOS at resumption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must familiarize themselves with Special Pre-open Session (SPOS) procedures as outlined in BSE notice 20120216-29
- All market participants should take note of the revocation and adjust their systems accordingly
- Members should contact BSE at 022-2272 8083 for any clarifications
- Companies and participants must recognize that the stock will trade under SPOS protocols initially

## Important Dates

- **March 28, 2016**: Original suspension of trading imposed (notice 20160328-15)
- **September 23, 2024**: NCLT order approving resolution plan
- **October 14, 2025**: BSE notice issued announcing revocation
- **October 16, 2025**: Trading suspension revoked; trading resumes with SPOS

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited market-wide impact as this affects a single company. However, for existing shareholders and potential investors in RNIT AI Solutions Ltd., this is highly significant as it restores liquidity after nearly 9 years of trading suspension.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to prepare their systems to handle the stock under SPOS procedures, which provides price discovery mechanisms for relisted securities. The SPOS process helps ensure orderly trading resumption after extended suspension periods.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders who have been unable to trade their holdings since 2016 will regain the ability to exit or adjust positions. New investors can now access the stock, subject to SPOS pricing mechanisms on the first day.

**Corporate Impact**: The successful resolution plan approval and trading resumption marks a significant milestone for RNIT AI Solutions Ltd. in emerging from corporate insolvency proceedings and returning to normal market operations.
