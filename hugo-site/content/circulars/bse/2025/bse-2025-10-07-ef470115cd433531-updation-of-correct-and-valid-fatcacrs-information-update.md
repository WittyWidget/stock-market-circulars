title: Postponement of Revised FATCA/CRS Document ID Type Implementation on BSE StAR
  MF Platform
---

## Summary

BSE has postponed the implementation of revised FATCA/CRS document ID types on the BSE StAR MF platform. The update, which was originally scheduled to go live on October 7, 2025, has been deferred until further notice. The revised document ID types were received from both RTAs as per Annexure II of the previous notice dated October 3, 2025. A new implementation date will be communicated through a separate notice.

## Key Points

- Revised FATCA/CRS document ID type implementation postponed from October 7, 2025
- Original plan was outlined in Notice No. 20251003-52 dated October 3, 2025
- Revised document ID types received from both RTAs as per Annexure II
- New Go-Live date to be announced via separate notice
- Members can contact Mutual Fund Helpdesk for queries

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This circular postpones previously announced platform updates related to FATCA/CRS document ID types.

## Compliance Requirements

- Members should await further notice for the revised Go-Live date
- Members can direct queries to BSE Mutual Fund Helpdesk at 022-45720450 and 022-45720650 (business days, 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM)
- Queries can also be raised on BSE CRS portal: https://bsecrs.bseindia.com

## Important Dates

- **October 3, 2025**: Original notice issued (Notice No. 20251003-52)
- **October 7, 2025**: Originally scheduled implementation date (now postponed)
- **To be announced**: Revised Go-Live date for FATCA/CRS document ID type updates

## Impact Assessment

The postponement has minimal immediate impact on market operations. Members and mutual fund participants can continue using existing FATCA/CRS document ID protocols until the revised implementation date is announced. This administrative delay provides additional time for preparation and system readiness. No trading or operational disruptions are expected from this postponement.
