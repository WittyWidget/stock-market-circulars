## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Limited to debt segment participants holding or trading these specific T-bills. No broader market implications as this is a standard maturity-related suspension.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members must ensure compliance systems are updated to prevent inadvertent trading in suspended securities. Investors holding these securities will receive redemption proceeds as per standard settlement procedures.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal, as securities approaching maturity typically have reduced trading activity. Investors seeking to exit positions should have done so prior to the suspension date.
