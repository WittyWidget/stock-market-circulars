## Regulatory Changes

The trading mechanism for SHLOKKA DYES LIMITED will change from Trade for Trade (T2T) settlement to Rolling settlement.

- Update their systems to reflect the group change from MT to M Group
- Note the effective date of November 04, 2025 for implementation

- **November 04, 2025**: Effective date for group transfer from MT to M Group

## Impact Assessment

This change has a positive impact on the stock's tradability. The transfer from Trade for Trade segment to Rolling segment indicates improved market standing and reduced restrictions. Rolling settlement typically provides better liquidity and flexibility for investors compared to T2T segment. This move suggests the company has met BSE's criteria for normal market operations and may attract increased trading interest due to reduced settlement constraints.
