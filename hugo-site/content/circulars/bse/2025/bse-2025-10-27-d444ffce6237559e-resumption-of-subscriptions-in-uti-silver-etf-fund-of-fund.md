title: Resumption of Subscriptions in UTI Silver ETF Fund of Fund
---

## Summary

UTI Asset Management Company Limited has announced the resumption of subscriptions in UTI Silver ETF Fund of Fund effective October 27, 2025. This follows the suspension of fresh and additional lumpsum investments that was implemented on October 13, 2025 via addendum. The decision to resume comes after normalization of market conditions, improved availability of physical silver in the domestic market, and reduction in premium on physical silver relative to international prices. All transaction types including fresh investments, additional lumpsum investments, and switch-in transactions will be accepted from the effective date.

## Key Points

- Resumption of all fresh and additional lumpsum investments and switch-in transactions effective October 27, 2025
- Previous suspension was implemented on October 13, 2025 due to market conditions
- Decision based on normalization of market conditions and availability of physical silver
- Premium on physical silver relative to international prices has reduced
- Daily transaction limits removed for new registrations under SIP, STP, SWP, Flexi STP and similar facilities
- All other terms and conditions of SID/KIM remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes. This is an operational decision by UTI AMC to lift previously imposed restrictions on the scheme.

## Compliance Requirements

- This addendum forms an integral part of the Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)
- Investors should read all scheme related documents carefully
- Standard mutual fund disclaimer applies: investments are subject to market risks

## Important Dates

- **October 26, 2025**: Notice-cum-Addendum issued (Circular No. 71/2025-26)
- **October 27, 2025**: Effective date for resumption of subscriptions
- **October 13, 2025**: Date when subscriptions were originally suspended
- **October 10, 2025**: Previous addendum date announcing suspension

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low to medium. This circular affects only investors in UTI Silver ETF Fund of Fund and does not have broader market implications.

**Investor Impact**: Positive for investors seeking exposure to silver through this fund of fund structure. Investors can now resume lumpsum investments and systematic plans without daily transaction limits.

**Operational Impact**: The resumption indicates stabilization in the domestic silver market with improved physical availability and pricing normalization. The 14-day suspension period suggests the market disruption was temporary and has been resolved satisfactorily for the AMC to resume normal operations.
