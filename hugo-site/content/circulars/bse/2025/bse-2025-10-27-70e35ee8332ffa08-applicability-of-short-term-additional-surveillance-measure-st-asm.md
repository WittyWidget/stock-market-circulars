## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must adhere to heightened surveillance measures for securities in ST-ASM framework
- Trading in these securities will be subject to additional monitoring and restrictions
- Securities marked with asterisk (*) are aligned with NSE framework
- SME scrips in ST-ASM are marked with @ symbol
- T+0 scrips shortlisted based on parent company are marked with ~ symbol

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** October 28, 2025 - All changes to ST-ASM framework become applicable

## Impact Assessment

The inclusion of 9 securities in the ST-ASM framework indicates increased regulatory scrutiny due to abnormal price movements or trading patterns. Securities under this framework face:

- Enhanced surveillance and monitoring
- Potential trading restrictions or additional margin requirements
- Reduced liquidity due to heightened compliance measures
- Increased scrutiny from market participants and regulators

The movement of GM Breweries Ltd and Silver Oak India Ltd from ST-ASM to LT-ASM (Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure) suggests sustained concerns requiring longer-term monitoring. Investors and traders in these securities should exercise caution and be aware of the additional compliance and operational impacts.
