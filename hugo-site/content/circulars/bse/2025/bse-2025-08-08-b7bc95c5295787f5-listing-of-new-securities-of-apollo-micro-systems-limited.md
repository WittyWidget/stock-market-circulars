## Impact Assessment

The preferential issue represents a significant dilution with 2.70 crore new shares being added to the existing share capital. All new shares are subject to lock-in until February 28, 2026, which means they cannot be traded immediately, providing some stability to the stock price. The issue to non-promoters may alter the shareholding pattern of the company.
