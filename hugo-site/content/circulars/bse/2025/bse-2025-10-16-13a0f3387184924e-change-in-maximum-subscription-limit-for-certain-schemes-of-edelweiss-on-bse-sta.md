## Summary

Edelweiss Asset Management Limited has announced significant restrictions on subscriptions for seven offshore schemes effective October 16, 2025. The AMC's available headroom for overseas investment as per the mutual fund level limit set on February 1, 2022 is nearing its threshold. New lump sum investments and switch-ins will be completely discontinued, while new systematic transactions (SIP/STP) will be capped at maximum INR 5,000 per PAN per day. This action follows SEBI's clarification dated June 17, 2022 regarding overseas investment limits. Existing systematic transactions remain unaffected.

## Key Points

- Restriction based on transaction reporting date
- Transactions reported till October 15, 2025 before cut-off time will not be subject to restrictions
- Existing systematic transactions (SIPs/STPs) will continue unaffected
- Action taken due to nearing of overseas investment headroom limits per February 1, 2022 threshold

The addendum forms an integral part of the SID/KIM/SAI and overrides any conflicting provisions.

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact (High)**: Investors looking to make fresh investments in these offshore schemes face severe restrictions. New investors cannot make lump sum investments, and those preferring systematic investments are limited to INR 5,000 per PAN per day, significantly constraining investment options for offshore exposure through these schemes.

**Market Impact (Medium)**: The restriction indicates broader pressure on industry-wide overseas investment limits. Other AMCs may face similar constraints if their overseas investment headroom approaches regulatory thresholds.

**Operational Impact (Medium)**: Existing SIP/STP investors are protected, but distribution channels and platforms must implement controls to enforce the INR 5,000 daily limit for new systematic plans and block new lump sum subscriptions and switch-ins.

**Portfolio Impact (High)**: Investors seeking international diversification through these specific Edelweiss schemes must explore alternative funds or AMCs with available overseas investment headroom, potentially disrupting planned asset allocation strategies.
