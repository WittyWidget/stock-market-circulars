title: 'Sub-Division of Equity Shares of ADANI POWER LTD (Scrip Code: 533096)'
---

## Summary

Adani Power Ltd (Scrip Code: 533096) has announced the subdivision of its equity shares. Each existing equity share of face value Rs.10 will be subdivided into five equity shares of face value Rs.2 each, with the record date set for September 22, 2025.

## Key Points

- One equity share of Rs.10 face value will become five equity shares of Rs.2 face value each
- Record date: September 22, 2025
- New subdivided shares will be effective from September 22, 2025
- Current ISIN INE814H01011 (Rs.10 paid-up) will become invalid for exchange transactions from September 22, 2025
- New ISIN for Rs.2 paid-up shares will be communicated separately

## Regulatory Changes

The existing ISIN Number INE814H01011 for Rs.10 paid-up shares will not be valid for transactions on the exchange on or after September 22, 2025. A new ISIN number for the Rs.2 paid-up shares will be assigned and communicated to the market.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the change in face value and ISIN
- All transactions after September 22, 2025 must use the new ISIN for Rs.2 shares
- Market participants should update their systems for the new share structure

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: September 22, 2025
- **Effective Date**: September 22, 2025 (for subdivided shares trading)
- **ISIN Validity**: Current ISIN invalid from September 22, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This subdivision will increase the number of shares outstanding by 5x while proportionally reducing the share price. Existing shareholders will receive five shares for each share held as of the record date. The action typically makes shares more accessible to retail investors due to lower absolute price per share, though it doesn't change the fundamental value of holdings.
