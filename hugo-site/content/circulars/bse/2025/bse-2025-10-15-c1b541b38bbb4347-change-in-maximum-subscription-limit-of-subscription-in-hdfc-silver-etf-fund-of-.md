## Compliance Requirements

## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact**: Investors seeking to make large investments in HDFC Silver ETF Fund of Fund will face daily limits, potentially requiring them to spread investments over multiple days or seek alternative silver investment vehicles. However, existing investors with systematic plans remain unaffected.

**Market Impact**: The restriction reflects heightened volatility in silver markets and represents a protective measure by the fund house. This may indicate broader concerns about rapid inflows during volatile periods and potential liquidity management challenges in the underlying silver ETF.

**Operational Impact**: Fund distributors and platforms must implement controls to enforce the per-PAN daily limit. The restriction applies only to new money flowing into the scheme, preserving investor flexibility for exits and existing commitments.
