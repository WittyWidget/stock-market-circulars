## Summary

BSE has issued detailed operational modalities for safer participation of retail investors in algorithmic trading, following SEBI circular dated February 4, 2025.

## Key Points

- Algo orders are defined as orders generated using automated execution logic
- Algo providers facilitating API-based algo orders must be empanelled with exchanges
- Exchanges must establish empanelment criteria and comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for algo testing
- Revised identification framework for location ID incorporating algo orders from client Direct API
- Clear roles and responsibilities defined for brokers and algo providers
- Registration process established for algos with circumstances requiring re-registration
- Enhanced confidentiality measures for retail algo strategies including NDAs and encrypted submissions

## Regulatory Changes

- Mandatory empanelment of algo providers with exchanges before facilitating retail algo trading
- Revised location ID framework with first 16-digits identification system
- New platform categorization: ETI (dealer/direct system), IBT (manual front-end), STWT (manual front-end)
- Comprehensive testing requirements before algo deployment
- Enhanced data flow protocols between algo providers, brokers, and exchanges

## Compliance Requirements

- Algo providers must complete empanelment process with specific criteria
- Brokers must implement comprehensive risk management systems for API orders
- All algos must undergo registration and testing as per exchange SOP
- Confidentiality agreements and encrypted submissions mandatory
- Compliance with SEBI outsourcing guidelines required
- Turnaround time specifications for different algo types (fast-track vs normal)

## Important Dates

- Framework builds on SEBI circular dated February 4, 2025
- Exchange notice 20250506-3 dated May 6, 2025 referenced
- Location ID provisions revised from Exchange notice 20120816-19 dated August 16, 2012

## Impact Assessment

- Brokers must upgrade systems and processes to accommodate new empanelment and registration requirements
- Algo providers face new compliance burden with empanelment criteria and ongoing obligations
- Enhanced protection for retail investors through improved oversight and testing procedures
- Market infrastructure development required for new identification and data flow systems
- Potential initial implementation challenges but long-term benefits for market integrity and investor protection
