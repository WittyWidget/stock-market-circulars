## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - affects existing shareholders of Utkarsh Small Finance Bank who hold rights entitlements. Provides liquidity window for those who wish to renounce their rights instead of subscribing.

**Operational Impact**: Medium - trading members need to ensure proper client communication, contract note disclaimers, and settlement procedures are in place for the 5-day trading window. The T+1 settlement and trade-for-trade basis requires careful operational handling.

**Investor Impact**: Shareholders have the option to either subscribe to the rights issue, trade their rights entitlements during the renunciation period, or let them lapse. Time-sensitive decision required within the specified trading window.
