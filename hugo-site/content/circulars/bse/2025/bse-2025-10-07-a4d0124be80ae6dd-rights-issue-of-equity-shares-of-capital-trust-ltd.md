## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders have the opportunity to subscribe to additional shares at Rs 14 per share in 1:1 ratio, which may result in dilution if not subscribed. The rights issue allows proportionate participation in capital raising.

**Trading Impact**: Stock will trade ex-rights from October 10, 2025, with theoretical price adjustment to reflect the rights entitlement separation. Trading members must process all transactions accordingly.

**Market Impact**: Medium impact limited to Capital Trust Ltd shareholders. The 1:1 ratio represents significant capital raising, doubling the equity base if fully subscribed.
