## Impact Assessment

The reduction in minimum application amounts from Rs. 500 to Rs. 100 for lumpsum investments and from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 100 for SIPs significantly lowers the entry barrier for retail investors. This change is expected to increase participation in liquid and overnight funds, particularly among small investors. The introduction of monthly SIP frequency for Axis Overnight Fund provides additional flexibility for investors seeking regular investment options.
