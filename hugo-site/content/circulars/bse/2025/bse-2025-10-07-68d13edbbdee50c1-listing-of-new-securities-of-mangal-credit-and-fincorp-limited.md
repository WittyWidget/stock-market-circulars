## Impact Assessment

This is a routine corporate action with minimal market impact. The preferential allotment to promoters increases the company's equity base by 15,50,000 shares. The lock-in period until April 2027 ensures these shares cannot be traded by promoters for approximately 18 months from the listing date, providing stability to the shareholding pattern. The warrant conversion represents fulfillment of prior fundraising commitments and does not affect general market operations or trading member obligations beyond normal listing procedures.
