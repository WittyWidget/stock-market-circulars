This circular has limited market impact as it pertains to a private limited company's debt instrument redemption. Only existing debenture holders are affected. The part redemption reduces the outstanding face value, which is a routine corporate action in debt markets. Trading members need to update their systems to reflect the new face value for accurate trade processing and settlement.
