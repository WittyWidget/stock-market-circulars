title: GSM Framework Updates - Three Securities Move to Different Surveillance Stages
---

## Summary

BSE has updated the Graded Surveillance Measure (GSM) framework affecting three securities. Two companies - MFS Intercorp Ltd. and Integrated Capital Services Ltd - have been moved to GSM Stage I, while GSL Securities Ltd. has been escalated to the more restrictive GSM Stage III surveillance level.

## Key Points

- MFS Intercorp Ltd. (Code: 513721, ISIN: INE614F01019) moved to GSM Stage I
- Integrated Capital Services Ltd (Code: 539149, ISIN: INE682B01023) moved to GSM Stage I
- GSL Securities Ltd. (Code: 530469, ISIN: INE721D01017) escalated to GSM Stage III
- Securities may move to lower GSM stages if included in ESM or IBC frameworks

## Regulatory Changes

The GSM framework provides a structured approach to surveillance with different stages imposing varying levels of restrictions and monitoring. Stage III represents a higher level of surveillance compared to Stage I, indicating increased regulatory scrutiny for GSL Securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Enhanced disclosure requirements for companies under GSM surveillance
- Stricter monitoring of price movements and trading volumes
- Additional compliance obligations as per respective GSM stage requirements
- Regular reporting and justification for unusual market activities

## Important Dates

- Circular Date: August 8, 2025
- Implementation: Effective immediately upon circular issuance

## Impact Assessment

The GSM stage movements will result in enhanced surveillance and potential trading restrictions for the affected securities. Investors should expect increased scrutiny of these stocks, which may impact liquidity and trading patterns. GSL Securities faces the highest level of surveillance under Stage III, which could significantly affect investor sentiment and trading activity.
