## Impact Assessment

The shut periods will temporarily restrict SLB activities in these 8 securities, affecting market participants who rely on securities lending and borrowing for hedging, arbitrage, or short-selling strategies. Participants should plan position management and foreclosures accordingly. The concentration of multiple shut periods in mid-October may require careful portfolio management for SLB market participants with exposure to multiple affected securities.
