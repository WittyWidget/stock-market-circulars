title: Corporate Action Updates in SLB Securities - September 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has issued corporate action notifications for 18 securities under the Securities Lending and Borrowing (SLB) mechanism. The circular covers dividend declarations for 17 companies and one stock split, with record dates ranging from September 8 to September 23, 2025.

## Key Points

- 17 companies declaring dividends with various record dates
- Tourism Finance Corporation announcing stock split with September 19, 2025 record date
- Ex-dates align with record dates for most securities
- Shut periods defined for each corporate action
- All actions affect SLB trading arrangements

## Corporate Actions Details

**Immediate Actions (September 8-9, 2025):**
- HFCL Limited, Birla Corporation, KDDL Ltd, Titagarh Rail Systems, ISGEC Heavy Engineering, Tega Industries, Housing & Urban Development Corporation - all with September 9 record date

**Mid-September Actions:**
- Cochin Shipyard (September 12), Indraprastha Gas & Phoenix Mills (September 15), Dixon Technologies (September 16)

**Later September Actions:**
- SJVN Limited & ACUTAAS Chemicals (September 18)
- Tourism Finance Corporation (stock split), NLC India, Himatsingka Seide, Bharat Dynamics (September 19)
- India Glycols (September 23)

## Trading Impact

**SLB Trading Restrictions:**
- Securities will have shut periods as specified
- Ex-dates will impact borrowing/lending positions
- Market participants must adjust SLB positions accordingly

## Important Dates

- **Immediate Effect:** September 8, 2025 (ex-date for multiple securities)
- **Record Date Range:** September 8-23, 2025
- **Shut Periods:** Vary by security, typically 1-5 days before record date

## Impact Assessment

Moderate impact on SLB market operations due to multiple simultaneous corporate actions. Traders and institutions involved in securities lending/borrowing must monitor shut periods and adjust positions to avoid settlement issues. The concentration of dividend actions in early September may temporarily reduce available inventory for lending.
