title: Clarifications to Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) for
  SEBI Regulated Entities
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued clarifications regarding the implementation of the Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) for regulated entities. The clarifications address two key areas: the methodology for counting registered clients for categorization purposes, and the criteria for determining whether trading members should be classified as proprietary or clientele-based for CSCRF applicability.

## Key Points

- Registered clients count must be based on Unique PAN, including both active and inactive clients
- Closed clients (marked as closed in UCC database) are excluded from the count
- Trading members with clientele turnover less than 10% of proprietary turnover are categorized as proprietary stockbrokers
- References multiple SEBI circulars including the main framework from August 20, 2024 and subsequent clarifications

## Regulatory Changes

The circular clarifies the interpretation of existing CSCRF regulations rather than introducing new requirements. The client counting methodology now explicitly includes both active and inactive clients based on Unique PAN, while excluding closed accounts. For mixed trading operations, a 10% threshold has been established to determine whether an entity should be classified as proprietary or clientele-based for CSCRF purposes.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must recalculate their registered client count using the clarified methodology (Unique PAN basis, including active and inactive, excluding closed)
- Entities engaged in both proprietary and clientele trading must assess their turnover ratio for the financial year (April 1 to March 31)
- If clientele trading turnover is less than 10% of proprietary trading turnover, the entity must comply with CSCRF requirements as a proprietary stockbroker
- All trading members must review their current categorization and adjust if necessary based on these clarifications

## Important Dates

- Financial year period for assessment: April 1 to March 31
- Original CSCRF circular: August 20, 2024
- Previous clarifications: December 31, 2024, March 28, 2025, April 30, 2025, August 28, 2025
- FAQ issued: June 11, 2025
- Current clarification: September 2, 2025

## Impact Assessment

These clarifications will primarily impact trading members' categorization under the CSCRF framework. Entities near the 10% threshold between proprietary and clientele trading may find themselves reclassified, potentially changing their compliance obligations. The clarified client counting methodology may also affect the tier classification of trading members, as the number of registered clients is a key parameter in determining applicable cybersecurity requirements. Trading members should reassess their position and ensure compliance with the appropriate tier of CSCRF requirements based on these clarifications.
