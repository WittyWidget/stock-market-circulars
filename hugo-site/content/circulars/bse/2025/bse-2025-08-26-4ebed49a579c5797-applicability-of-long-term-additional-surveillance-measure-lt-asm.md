## Summary

BSE has updated the Long Term Additional Surveillance Measure (LT-ASM) Framework effective August 28, 2025. Seven securities have been shortlisted for inclusion in LT-ASM Stage I, while one security (OTCO International Ltd) is moving out due to inclusion in GSM Framework.

## Key Points

- 7 securities newly shortlisted for Long Term ASM Framework Stage I
- 1 security (OTCO International Ltd) moving out of LT-ASM Framework
- No securities moving between ASM stages
- No securities shortlisted for Direct Stage IV Long Term ASM
- Consolidated list shows over 13 securities currently under various ASM stages

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of Long Term ASM Framework updates with specific securities categorization based on surveillance requirements and risk assessment criteria.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must comply with LT-ASM trading restrictions for listed securities
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting requirements for affected securities
- Adherence to stage-specific trading parameters and settlement procedures

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 28, 2025 - New LT-ASM classifications take effect

## Impact Assessment

The LT-ASM measures will impose additional trading restrictions on 7 securities, potentially reducing liquidity and requiring higher margins. OTCO International Ltd gains relief from LT-ASM restrictions but faces GSM Framework requirements. Investors in affected securities should expect modified trading parameters and enhanced surveillance.
