- **Trading Commencement**: October 9, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low. This is a routine preferential allotment listing for a single company. The preferential issue represents capital raising by Unicommerce eSolutions Limited.

**Shareholder Impact**: The allotment of approximately 6 million shares to non-promoters will dilute existing shareholders. The lock-in period until April 2026 prevents immediate selling pressure.

**Liquidity Impact**: Minimal immediate impact as all shares are locked-in for approximately 6 months from trading commencement date. Post lock-in expiry, these shares may add to the tradable float.
