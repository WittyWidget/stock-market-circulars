## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard listing notification for new securities.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the listing of these new securities for trading purposes
- Lock-in restrictions apply to all allotted shares as specified below
- Market participants must recognize the dilution impact in trading and risk management

## Important Dates

- **Date of Allotment:** June 6, 2025
- **Trading Commencement:** October 15, 2025
- **Lock-in Expiry (Tranche 1):** April 30, 2026 for 72,50,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 190384001 to 197634000)
- **Lock-in Expiry (Tranche 2):** April 30, 2027 for 1,75,50,000 shares (Dist. Nos. 172834001 to 190384000)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** The issuance of 2.48 crore shares represents significant equity dilution. However, the staggered lock-in periods (72.5 lakh shares locked until April 2026 and 1.755 crore shares locked until April 2027) will limit immediate supply pressure on the stock price. The preferential allotment at Rs. 40.50 per share establishes a reference price point for market participants.

**Liquidity Impact:** Trading liquidity may improve marginally post-listing, though the majority of shares remain locked for 1.5 to 2.5 years. Only non-locked portions, if any, would be immediately tradable.

**Operational Impact:** Routine listing procedure with no operational changes for trading members beyond recognizing the expanded share capital in their systems.
