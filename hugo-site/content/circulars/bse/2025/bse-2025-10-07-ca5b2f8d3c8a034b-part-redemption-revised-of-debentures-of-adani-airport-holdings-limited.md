## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - This revision affects only holders and traders of this specific AAHL debenture series. The reduced face value reflects the part redemption already completed, ensuring accurate pricing and valuation in the debt market.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members dealing in these debentures must update their systems immediately to reflect the revised face value. Failure to do so could result in incorrect trade pricing and settlement issues.

**Investor Impact**: Debenture holders have received partial redemption, and the remaining debentures now have a reduced face value. This is a routine corporate action for debt securities and does not indicate financial distress.
