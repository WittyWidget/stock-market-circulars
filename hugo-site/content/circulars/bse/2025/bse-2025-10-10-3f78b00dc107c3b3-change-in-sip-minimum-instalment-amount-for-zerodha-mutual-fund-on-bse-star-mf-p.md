## Summary

Zerodha Asset Management Private Limited has issued Addendum No. 05/2025-26 revising the minimum Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) amount for daily frequency investments in the Zerodha Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index Fund. The minimum daily SIP installment has been reduced from ₹100 to ₹10, effective from August 06, 2025. This change applies to the scheme on the BSE StAR MF platform.

## Regulatory Changes

This addendum modifies the Scheme Information Document (SID) of the Zerodha Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index Fund. The revision pertains specifically to the minimum investment amount for daily SIP frequency, making it more accessible to small retail investors. All other terms and conditions in the SID remain unchanged.

## Impact Assessment

This change has a positive impact on retail investor accessibility by lowering the barrier to entry for daily SIP investments in the Zerodha Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index Fund. The 90% reduction in minimum investment amount (from ₹100 to ₹10) enables smaller investors to participate in systematic investment plans with minimal commitment. The change is specific to one fund and does not have broader market implications, but represents investor-friendly policy implementation by Zerodha Mutual Fund on the BSE StAR MF platform.
