## Important Dates

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact expected as this is a routine administrative process for ESOP share listings. The relatively small number of shares (ranging from 3,830 to 164,008 per company) suggests limited dilution effect on existing shareholdings. Companies benefit from improved employee incentivization through stock options.
