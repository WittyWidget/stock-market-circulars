## Impact Assessment

**Shareholder Impact**: Existing shareholders receive one additional share for every 10 shares held, increasing their shareholding by 10% while maintaining proportionate ownership. The share split from Rs. 10 to Re. 1 improves affordability and may enhance liquidity.

**Market Impact**: The bonus issue increases the total share count by 10%, which may improve market liquidity. Combined with the 10:1 share split, the lower face value makes shares more accessible to retail investors. No dilution of ownership as bonus shares are issued proportionately.

**Capital Structure Impact**: Total issued and paid-up capital increases from Rs. 112.36 crores to Rs. 123.59 crores, though this is capitalization of reserves with no fresh capital infusion. The revised capital structure reflects both the bonus issue and share split adjustments.
