title: Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) Framework Updates - August 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has updated its Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework effective August 1, 2025. Six securities have been newly included in the ESM framework, while one security (RSC International Ltd) will be moved to a higher ESM stage. No securities are being removed from the framework.

## Key Points

- 6 new securities added to ESM framework: Aryavan Enterprise Ltd, Bhakti Gems and Jewellery Ltd, Deepak Chemtex Ltd (SME), Omax Autos Ltd, Remi Edelstahl Tubulars Ltd, and Vashu Bhagnani Industries Ltd
- RSC International Ltd moved to higher ESM stage
- No securities moving to lower ESM stage
- No securities being removed from ESM framework
- Framework includes securities across ESM Stage I and Stage II
- One SME scrip (Deepak Chemtex Ltd) included in new additions

## Regulatory Changes

The ESM framework continues to operate with its established stage-based approach, with securities being classified into different stages based on their risk profile and market behavior.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must adhere to enhanced surveillance conditions for all listed securities
- Trading in ESM securities subject to additional monitoring and restrictions
- Brokers and investors must comply with enhanced disclosure and reporting requirements

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: August 1, 2025
- All changes to ESM classifications become applicable from market opening on this date

## Impact Assessment

The addition of 6 securities to ESM framework will result in enhanced monitoring and potential trading restrictions for these scrips. The move of RSC International Ltd to a higher ESM stage indicates continued concerns about the security's trading patterns. Market participants trading in these securities should expect increased scrutiny and compliance requirements.
