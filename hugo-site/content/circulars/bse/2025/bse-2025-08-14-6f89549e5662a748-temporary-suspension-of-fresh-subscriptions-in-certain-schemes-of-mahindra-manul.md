## Summary

Mahindra Manulife Investment Management has temporarily suspended fresh subscriptions in its Asia Pacific REITs Fund of Fund scheme effective July 31, 2025, as a precautionary measure to avoid breaching overseas investment limits set by RBI and monitored by SEBI.

## Key Points

- Fresh lumpsum subscriptions suspended from July 31, 2025
- New systematic registrations including STP into the scheme suspended
- Switch-ins to the scheme temporarily halted
- Existing SIPs and STPs registered before effective date will continue
- Intra-scheme and intra-plan switches remain unaffected
- Suspension is temporary until headroom increases or limits are enhanced

## Regulatory Changes

The suspension follows SEBI guidelines and AMFI communications regarding industry-wide overseas investment limits. Previous suspensions occurred in January 2022 with resumption in July 2022 under specific headroom conditions.

## Compliance Requirements

- Fund house must monitor overseas investment limits to prevent breaches
- Designated employee investments must be in schemes with equivalent or higher risk ratings
- Scheme Information Document and Key Information Memorandum to be updated

## Important Dates

- **July 31, 2025**: Effective date for subscription suspension
- **January 28, 2022**: Original SEBI communication on overseas limits
- **July 1, 2022**: Previous resumption of subscriptions

## Impact Assessment

Existing investors can continue their systematic investments and perform internal switches. The measure is precautionary and temporary, with resumption dependent on regulatory limit changes or increased available headroom.
