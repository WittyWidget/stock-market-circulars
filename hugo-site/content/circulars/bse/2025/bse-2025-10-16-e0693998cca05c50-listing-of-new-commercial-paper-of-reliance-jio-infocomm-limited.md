**Issuer Profile**: Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited is a well-established telecom operator with strong credit ratings, indicating low default risk.

**Liquidity**: These Commercial Papers provide additional short-term debt instruments for institutional investors in the BSE Debt segment. Trading expected to be limited given private placement nature and institutional investor base.

**Risk Assessment**: Low risk given (1) short tenure of approximately 2 months, (2) highest credit ratings from both CARE and CRISIL, and (3) issuer's strong financial position.
