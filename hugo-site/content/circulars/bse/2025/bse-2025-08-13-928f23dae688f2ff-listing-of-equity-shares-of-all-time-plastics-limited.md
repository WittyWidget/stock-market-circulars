title: Listing of Equity Shares of ALL TIME PLASTICS LIMITED with Lock-in Details
---

## Summary

ALL TIME PLASTICS LIMITED has provided detailed lock-in schedules for its equity shares following IPO listing. The document outlines distinctive numbers, lock-in periods ranging from 30 days to 3 years, and specific provisions for different investor categories including anchor investors and Alternative Investment Funds.

## Key Points

- Total of 6,55,07,778 equity shares with varying lock-in periods
- 1,02,10,258 shares are not under lock-in (IPO public portion)
- Multiple tranches with lock-in periods from 30 days to 3 years
- All shares are in demat form
- Different lock-in rules apply to anchor investors and AIF Category II

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes - standard compliance with SEBI ICDR Regulations 2018 for post-IPO lock-in requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Compliance with Regulation 17(c) of SEBI ICDR Regulations 2018
- AIF Category II (Abakkus Four2Eight Opportunities Fund) subject to special lock-in till December 31, 2025
- Anchor investor shares locked for 30 days and 90 days respectively
- Company must maintain accurate records of lock-in schedules

## Important Dates

- Lock-in start date: August 12, 2025
- Anchor investor 30-day lock-in expires: September 10, 2025
- Anchor investor 90-day lock-in expires: November 9, 2025
- AIF lock-in expires: December 31, 2025
- Various other lock-in expiry dates: February 14, 2026 to August 14, 2028

## Impact Assessment

Medium impact on share liquidity as significant portion of shares remain locked. The staggered lock-in expiry dates will gradually increase tradeable float over time. Anchor investor lock-ins expiring in September/November 2025 may provide initial liquidity boost. Long-term lock-ins extending to 2028 will limit supply and potentially support share price stability.
