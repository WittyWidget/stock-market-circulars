title: No Dealings in Partly Paid Equity Shares UPL LIMITED (Scrip Code 890209)
---

## Summary

BSE has suspended trading in UPL Limited's partly paid equity shares (Scrip Code 890209) effective August 1, 2025. The suspension is due to the company fixing a record date to identify shareholders eligible to receive the second and final call notice for additional payment of Rs. 180 per partly paid share.

## Key Points

- Trading suspension applies only to UPL Limited partly paid equity shares (Code: 890209)
- Record date fixed as August 1, 2025
- Second and final call money: Rs. 180 per partly paid share (Re. 1 face value + Rs. 179 premium)
- Trading members advised not to deal in these shares from August 1, 2025
- Settlement number: DR-686/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action procedure for partly paid shares.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealings in UPL partly paid equity shares from August 1, 2025
- Trading members required to take note of the suspension
- Compliance with corporate action procedures for record date determination

## Important Dates

- **Record Date**: August 1, 2025
- **No Dealings From**: August 1, 2025
- **Notice Date**: July 30, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Limited market impact as suspension affects only UPL's partly paid equity shares, not regular equity shares. Shareholders holding partly paid shares will need to pay the second and final call money of Rs. 180 per share. Trading suspension ensures proper identification of eligible shareholders for the call notice.
