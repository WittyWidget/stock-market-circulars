## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The open offer provides an exit opportunity for public shareholders at Rs. 11 per share. The acquisition of 26% stake represents a significant change in shareholding pattern of Hypersoft Technologies Limited.

**Shareholder Impact**: Public shareholders holding 22,17,160 shares have the option to tender their shares. The preferential allotment of 36,05,000 shares has already altered the capital structure, with these shares locked-in and not eligible for tendering.

**Operational Impact**: The takeover may lead to changes in management and strategic direction of Hypersoft Technologies Limited. The acquirer's dual residence (India and Singapore) suggests potential for international business operations or restructuring.

**Regulatory Compliance**: The offer is being conducted in full compliance with SEBI SAST Regulations, 2011, with all necessary stock exchange approvals obtained. No additional statutory approvals are currently required, though the offer would be subject to any approvals that become applicable prior to completion.
