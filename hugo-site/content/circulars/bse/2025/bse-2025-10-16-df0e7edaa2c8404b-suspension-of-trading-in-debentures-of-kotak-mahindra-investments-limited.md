---

## Summary

BSE has announced the suspension of trading in specific Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) issued by Kotak Mahindra Investments Limited effective October 20, 2025. The suspension is implemented due to the company fixing a record date for redemption purposes. Trading members are explicitly advised not to deal in the specified debentures from the suspension date.

## Key Points

- Trading suspended for debentures with ISIN INE975F07HU4 (Code: 974317)
- Debenture series: KMIL-8%-4-11-25-PVT (8% coupon rate)
- Record date set for October 20, 2025
- No dealings permitted from October 20, 2025 onwards
- Suspension notice reference: DR-739/2025-2026
- Notice issued by Marian Dsouza, Assistant Vice President â€“ Listing Operations (CRD)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a standard operational procedure for debenture redemption requiring trading suspension to prevent transactions after the record date.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must cease all dealings in the specified debentures from October 20, 2025
- Members must ensure no trades are executed in ISIN INE975F07HU4 after the suspension date
- Trading members are required to take note of this suspension and communicate to relevant stakeholders

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 16, 2025
- **Record Date**: October 20, 2025
- **Suspension Effective From**: October 20, 2025
- **Purpose Date**: Redemption scheduled as per debenture terms

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - affects only holders of this specific debenture series

**Operational Impact**: Minimal - routine suspension process for single debenture series redemption

**Investor Impact**: Limited to existing debenture holders who will receive redemption proceeds as per terms. No new trading activity permitted after record date, which is standard practice for debt instrument redemptions.

**Liquidity Impact**: No broader market liquidity concerns as this applies to a single private placement debenture series with limited secondary market trading.
