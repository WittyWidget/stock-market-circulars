## Summary

BSE has updated the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective September 2, 2025. Eight securities are being added to the ST-ASM framework, while 16 securities are being removed from the framework due to various reasons including inclusion in other surveillance measures.

## Key Points

- 8 securities shortlisted for ST-ASM framework (5/15/30 Days) including Coffee Day Enterprises, Royal Orchid Hotels, and others
- 16 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework, including Ola Electric Mobility and Southern Petrochemicals
- No securities moving to higher or lower stage ASM within the framework
- Includes both main board and SME securities
- Some securities moving out due to inclusion in other frameworks (LT-ASM, ESM, etc.)

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of updated ST-ASM framework with revised list of securities under surveillance. Securities under ST-ASM are subject to enhanced monitoring and may have specific trading restrictions or margin requirements.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must comply with enhanced surveillance measures for securities listed in ST-ASM
- Additional margin requirements and position limits may apply
- Enhanced disclosure and monitoring requirements for trading in these securities

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: September 2, 2025 - New ST-ASM framework becomes applicable

## Impact Assessment

Moderate impact on trading activities for the affected securities. Securities entering ST-ASM may face increased trading costs and restrictions, while those exiting may see normalized trading conditions. The framework aims to maintain market integrity by monitoring securities with unusual price movements or trading patterns.
