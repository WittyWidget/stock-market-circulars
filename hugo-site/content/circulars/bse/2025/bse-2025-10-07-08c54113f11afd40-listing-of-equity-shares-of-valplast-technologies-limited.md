## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The listing adds liquidity to the market with a new company joining the exchange. The staggered lock-in periods will result in gradual release of shares into the market over a 3-year period.

**Trading Impact**: Immediate trading is available for IPO-free shares (portion not locked-in), while anchor investor shares will become tradable between November 2025 and January 2026. Promoter shares will be released gradually between 2026 and 2028, preventing sudden supply shocks.

**Investor Impact**: Retail and institutional investors who participated in the IPO can begin trading their allotted shares as per the lock-in schedule applicable to their category.
