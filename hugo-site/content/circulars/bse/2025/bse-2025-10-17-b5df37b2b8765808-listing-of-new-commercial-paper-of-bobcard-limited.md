## Impact Assessment

This is a routine short-term debt instrument listing with minimal market impact. Commercial Paper is a standard money market instrument used by companies for short-term funding needs. The IND A1+ rating indicates highest safety for short-term debt. The instrument is restricted to institutional and sophisticated investors due to the Rs. 5 lakh minimum denomination requirement, limiting retail participation. The 68-day tenor suggests working capital financing requirements. No impact on equity markets or broader trading operations.
