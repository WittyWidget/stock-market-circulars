---

## Summary

BSE has informed trading members about the partial redemption of debentures issued by Provident Cedar Private Limited. The company has reduced the face value per debenture following partial redemption, with the new reduced face value becoming effective from September 9, 2025.

## Key Points

- Provident Cedar Private Limited (Scrip Code: PCPL-17-4-28-PVT, ISIN: INE0NF907031, Code: 974311) is conducting partial redemption of debentures
- New reduced face value: Rs. 316,540.54 per debenture
- Effective date for trading with reduced face value: September 9, 2025
- Reference: DR-711/2025-2026

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action notification for debenture partial redemption.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the reduced face value for debenture trading
- All trades from September 9, 2025 onwards must reflect the new face value of Rs. 316,540.54 per debenture

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: September 8, 2025
- **Effective Date**: September 9, 2025 (trading with reduced face value begins)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this affects only one private limited company's debentures. The partial redemption reduces the outstanding debt obligation and adjusts the trading parameters for existing debenture holders. No broader market implications expected.
