- Largest market-wide limit: Easy Trip Planners (180.84 million shares)
- ETF limits include major funds like UTI Nifty Bank ETF (65.02 million shares)

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must adhere to the specified position limits
- Client-level positions cannot exceed 1% of market-wide limits

## Impact Assessment

The limits ensure adequate liquidity while preventing excessive concentration in individual securities. ETF limits are particularly significant given their popularity in lending programs, with some major ETFs having substantial lending capacity.
