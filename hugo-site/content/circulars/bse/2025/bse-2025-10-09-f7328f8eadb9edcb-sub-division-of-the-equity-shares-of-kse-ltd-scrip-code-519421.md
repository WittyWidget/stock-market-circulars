---

## Summary

KSE Ltd (Scrip Code: 519421) has announced the sub-division of its equity shares, splitting one equity share of face value Rs.10 into ten equity shares of face value Re.1 each. The record date and effective date for this corporate action is October 28, 2025. The existing ISIN (INE953E01014) will become invalid for transactions from the effective date, and a new ISIN will be assigned for the Re.1 paid-up shares.

## Key Points

- Sub-division ratio: 1 equity share of Rs.10 split into 10 equity shares of Re.1 each
- Record date: October 28, 2025
- Effective date: October 28, 2025
- Company: KSE Ltd (Scrip Code: 519421)
- Segment: Equity - Dematerialised Securities Rolling Settlement
- Reference: DR-744/2025-2026
- Existing ISIN INE953E01014 (Rs.10 paid-up) will be invalid from effective date
- New ISIN for Re.1 paid-up shares to be notified separately

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory framework changes. This is a standard corporate action under existing SEBI regulations for share sub-division.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must note the record date of October 28, 2025
- Transactions using old ISIN (INE953E01014) will not be valid on or after October 28, 2025
- Members must await separate notification for new ISIN number for Re.1 paid-up shares
- Systems must be updated to reflect the new face value and ISIN once notified

## Important Dates

- **October 9, 2025**: Circular issued
- **October 28, 2025**: Record date for sub-division
- **October 28, 2025**: Effective date - old ISIN becomes invalid, new face value applicable
- **To be announced**: New ISIN notification date

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium. The sub-division will increase the number of outstanding shares by 10x while reducing face value proportionally, improving liquidity and affordability for retail investors. Stock price will adjust proportionally on the effective date.

**Trading Impact**: Trading members need to update systems and be prepared for ISIN change. The old ISIN will cease to be valid from October 28, 2025, requiring coordination to ensure smooth transition.

**Investor Impact**: Existing shareholders will receive 10 shares for every 1 share held as of the record date. The total investment value remains unchanged, but individual share price will be approximately 1/10th of pre-split price.
