## Regulatory Changes

The Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework is a proactive surveillance mechanism to enhance market integrity and safeguard investor interest. Securities under ESM are subject to:

- Enhanced monitoring by the exchange
- Potential additional margin requirements
- Staged approach with progressive restrictions based on continued concerns
- Regular review for upgrade, downgrade, or removal from framework

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure compliance with ESM provisions for listed securities
- Investors should be aware of enhanced surveillance status when trading these securities
- Additional due diligence recommended for securities under ESM framework
- Margin requirements and trading restrictions may apply as per ESM stage

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date**: October 24, 2025
- **Circular Date**: October 23, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - Affects liquidity and trading activity in the listed securities. Securities under ESM typically experience reduced trading volumes due to heightened investor caution and potential additional margin requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or trading these securities should exercise increased caution. ESM placement indicates exchange concerns about price movements, volatility, or other market integrity issues. Additional margins may be required for trading.

**Operational Impact**: Trading members need to update their systems to reflect ESM status and ensure appropriate risk management measures are in place for these securities.
