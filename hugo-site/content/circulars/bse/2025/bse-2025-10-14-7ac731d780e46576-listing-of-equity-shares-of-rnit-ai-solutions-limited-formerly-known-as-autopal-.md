## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: High - Complete ownership restructuring with 100% promoter exit and significant public shareholding dilution (75% reduction) creates substantial changes in shareholder composition. The 5:1 merger ratio significantly increases share count.

**Trading Impact**: Trading restricted to XT Group trade-to-trade segment indicates enhanced surveillance due to company's insolvency background, limiting liquidity and imposing stricter settlement requirements.

**Investor Impact**: Existing public shareholders experienced 75% reduction in holdings. New investor base includes resolution applicant with significant 30 lakh share stake and former RNIT Solutions & Services shareholders who received majority of post-merger shares (7.14 crore shares).

**Operational Impact**: Company emerged from insolvency with fresh capital structure, name change reflecting AI business focus, and registered office in Jaipur, Rajasthan.
