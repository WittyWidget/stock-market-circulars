## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** High - This is a significant corporate action involving change of control or substantial acquisition affecting 26% of the company's expanded capital. Public shareholders face a critical decision regarding tendering their shares.

**Shareholder Impact:** High - Existing public shareholders holding 22,17,160 shares have opportunity to exit at Rs. 11 per share. Those holding preferential allotment shares (36,05,000) are restricted from participating due to lock-in requirements.

**Corporate Governance Impact:** This open offer follows SEBI SAST regulations triggered by preferential allotment that likely increased promoter/acquirer holding beyond prescribed thresholds, requiring mandatory open offer to public shareholders.

**Operational Impact:** Medium - No conditional approvals required except those already obtained. The offer is unconditional regarding minimum acceptance levels, providing certainty to all parties regarding offer completion.
