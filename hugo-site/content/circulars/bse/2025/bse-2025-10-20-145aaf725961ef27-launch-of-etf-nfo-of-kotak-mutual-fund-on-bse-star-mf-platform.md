## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Low - This is a routine NFO launch for a sector-specific ETF tracking NIFTY CHEMICALS index. It provides investors with a new passive investment option in the chemicals sector but does not affect existing market operations or trading mechanisms.

**Operational Impact**: Low - Standard NFO operational procedures apply. Members familiar with BSE StAR MF Platform NFO processes will follow established protocols for fund collection, transaction management, and allotment coordination. The extended trading hours till midnight on closing day is a standard feature for NFO lumpsum purchases.
