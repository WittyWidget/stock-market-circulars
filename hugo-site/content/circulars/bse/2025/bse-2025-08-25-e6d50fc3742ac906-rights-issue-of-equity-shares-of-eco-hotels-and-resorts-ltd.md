## Impact Assessment

This rights issue will dilute existing shareholding but provides existing shareholders the opportunity to maintain their proportional ownership by subscribing to additional shares. The staggered payment structure (Rs 3.80 on application, Rs 11.40 in calls) makes the subscription more accessible to shareholders. Trading will shift to ex-rights basis, affecting share pricing and trading patterns from the record date.
