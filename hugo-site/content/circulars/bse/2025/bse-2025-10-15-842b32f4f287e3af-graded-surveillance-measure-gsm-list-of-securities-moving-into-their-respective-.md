- Increased margin requirements for trading
- Price bands may be reduced
- Trade-for-trade settlement with no intraday positions
- Additional surveillance and monitoring by the exchange

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors and traders should be aware that securities under GSM are subject to enhanced surveillance
- Trading members must ensure compliance with additional margin and settlement requirements applicable to each GSM stage
- Market participants should review the specific restrictions applicable to each GSM stage before trading these securities
- Investors are advised to exercise additional caution and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in GSM securities

## Important Dates

- **Circular Date**: October 15, 2025
- **Effective Date**: As per exchange notification (typically effective immediately or from next trading session)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Medium - The movement of these 8 securities to various GSM stages will result in increased trading restrictions and margin requirements, which may impact liquidity and investor participation in these stocks.

**Investor Impact**: Investors holding or planning to trade these securities should be aware of the enhanced surveillance status, which signals potential concerns about price volatility, corporate governance, or other risk factors. Higher GSM stages (III and IV) indicate more serious concerns.

**Trading Impact**: Securities in higher GSM stages face stricter trading conditions including higher margins, trade-for-trade settlement, and tighter price bands, which can significantly reduce trading volumes and liquidity.

**Risk Alert**: The GSM classification serves as an important risk indicator for market participants, suggesting the need for enhanced due diligence and caution when dealing with these securities.
