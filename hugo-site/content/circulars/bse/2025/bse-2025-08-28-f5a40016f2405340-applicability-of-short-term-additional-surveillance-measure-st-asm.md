title: Applicability of Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM)

## Summary

BSE has announced changes to the Short Term Additional Surveillance Measure (ST-ASM) framework effective August 29, 2025. Four securities are being newly included in the ST-ASM framework, while nine securities are moving out of the framework due to inclusion in other surveillance measures.

## Key Points

- 4 securities newly shortlisted for ST-ASM framework including ADC India Communications Ltd, Affordable Robotic & Automation Ltd, Lactose India Ltd, and Raghuvansh Agrofarms Ltd
- 9 securities moving out of ST-ASM framework, with some moving to Enhanced Surveillance Measure (ESM) framework
- No securities moving to higher or lower stage ASM within the ST-ASM framework
- Changes take effect from August 29, 2025
- Consolidated list shows securities across different stages of ST-ASM

## Regulatory Changes

Implementation of Short Term 5/15/30 Days ASM Framework with updated security classifications and stage movements between different surveillance measures.

## Compliance Requirements

- Market participants must adjust trading strategies for securities entering ST-ASM
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting requirements for affected securities
- Compliance with specific trading restrictions under surveillance measures

## Important Dates

- **August 29, 2025**: Effective date for all ST-ASM framework changes

## Impact Assessment

The surveillance measures will impose additional trading restrictions on the newly included securities, potentially affecting liquidity and trading volumes. Securities moving out of ST-ASM to other frameworks like ESM may face different but continued restrictions. This affects both retail and institutional investors trading in these specific securities.
