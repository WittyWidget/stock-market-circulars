## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Trading members and direct investors participating in SDL markets need to coordinate bidding activities within specified timelines. The 24-hour bid collection window (with different cutoffs for direct investors vs. members) requires careful timing management.

**Investment Considerations:** Mix of new issues and re-issues with coupon rates ranging from 7.14% to 7.57% on re-issues. New issues will have coupon rates determined through the auction process. Maturity profiles span from 7 years (TN SDL 2032) to 30 years (MH SDL 2050, RJ SDL 2051, TN 2055).
