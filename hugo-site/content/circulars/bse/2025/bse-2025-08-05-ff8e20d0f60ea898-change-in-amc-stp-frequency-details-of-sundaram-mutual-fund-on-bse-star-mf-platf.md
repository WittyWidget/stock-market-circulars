title: Sundaram Mutual Fund Changes Weekly SIP/STP Processing from Wednesday-only
  to All Working Days
---

## Summary

Sundaram Mutual Fund has announced changes to the weekly frequency processing of Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) and Systematic Transfer Plans (STP). Previously processed only on Wednesdays, weekly SIP/STP requests will now be processed on all working days of the week, effective August 4, 2025.

## Key Points

- Weekly SIP/STP processing changes from Wednesday-only to all working days
- Change affects Scheme Information Document (SID) and Key Information Memorandum (KIM)
- Effective date: August 4, 2025
- Announced by Sundaram Trustee Company Limited
- All other terms and conditions remain unchanged

## Regulatory Changes

**Previous Process:**
- Weekly frequency SIP/STP requests processed only on Wednesday of every week
- If Wednesday was not a business day, processing occurred on next business day
- Investors could choose any weekday, but default was Wednesday

**New Process:**
- Weekly frequency SIP/STP requests processed on all working days of the week
- Provides greater flexibility for investors

## Compliance Requirements

- Sundaram Mutual Fund to update SID and KIM documents
- Addendum forms integral part of scheme documents
- No additional compliance requirements for investors

## Important Dates

- **Announcement Date:** July 29, 2025
- **Effective Date:** August 4, 2025

## Impact Assessment

This change provides operational flexibility for Sundaram Mutual Fund investors by allowing weekly SIP/STP processing on any working day rather than restricting to Wednesdays. The impact is limited to Sundaram MF scheme investors and represents an improvement in service delivery rather than a regulatory burden. Market-wide impact is minimal as this affects only one fund house's operational procedures.
