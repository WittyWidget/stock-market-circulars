title: Changes in Price Band for 14 Securities Effective October 15, 2025
---

## Summary

BSE has announced revisions to price bands for 14 securities effective from October 15, 2025. The revised price bands range from 2% to 20%, representing changes from their existing levels. This is a surveillance measure to regulate price volatility in these stocks.

## Key Points

- 14 securities will have revised price bands effective October 15, 2025
- Price bands vary from 2% (tightest) to 20% (widest)
- Four stocks receive 2% price band: Shree Krishna Paper Mills, Systematix Securities, Women Networks
- Four stocks receive 5% price band: Angel Fibers, Cambridge Technology, Century Extrusions, Finelistings Technologies, Getalong Enterprise, Nagreeka Capital
- Three stocks receive 10% price band: Regent Enterprises, True Colors, We Win
- Two stocks receive 20% price band: Aptus Pharma, Bharatrohan Airborne Innovations
- Notice issued by Surveillance Department

## Regulatory Changes

Price band revisions are surveillance measures implemented by BSE to control excessive price volatility and protect investor interests. Tighter bands (2-5%) indicate higher surveillance concern, while wider bands (20%) suggest relatively normal trading parameters.

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must ensure all trades in these securities comply with the revised price bands from October 15, 2025
- Members requiring clarification should contact bse.surv@bseindia.com
- Trading systems must be updated to reflect new price band parameters

## Important Dates

- **Notice Date**: October 14, 2025
- **Effective Date**: October 15, 2025

## Impact Assessment

**Trading Impact**: The revised price bands will limit intraday price movements in these securities. Stocks with tighter 2% bands (Shree Krishna Paper Mills, Systematix Securities, Women Networks) will experience the most restricted trading ranges, potentially reducing liquidity but providing price stability. Stocks with 5% bands will have moderate restrictions, while those with 10-20% bands will have relatively more trading flexibility.

**Investor Impact**: Investors in these securities should be aware that orders placed beyond the price band limits will be rejected. The tighter bands may protect against extreme volatility but could also limit profit opportunities in volatile markets.

**Market Operations**: This is a routine surveillance action indicating BSE's ongoing monitoring of price movements and market integrity across these specific securities.
