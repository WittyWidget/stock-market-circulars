  for SEBI Regulated Entities
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued comprehensive technical clarifications to the Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework (CSCRF) originally published on August 20, 2024. The clarifications address queries from regulated entities and provide guidance for entities operating under multiple regulatory jurisdictions, along with re-categorization of certain entity types and CERT-In audit policy guidelines.

## Key Points

- Technical clarifications issued in four parts: principles for multi-regulated entities, technical clarifications, re-categorization of Portfolio Managers and Merchant Bankers, and CERT-In audit guidelines
- Framework applies to all SEBI regulated entities including AIFs, clearing corporations, depositories, mutual funds, stock exchanges, and brokers
- Special provisions for entities regulated by multiple authorities (e.g., banks regulated by both SEBI and RBI)
- Multiple previous clarifications and extensions have been issued since the original framework

## Regulatory Changes

- Establishes comprehensive cybersecurity requirements for all SEBI regulated entities
- Introduces specific compliance obligations for data protection and IT infrastructure security
- Creates framework for entities operating under multiple regulatory jurisdictions
- Re-categorizes certain entity types for framework applicability

## Compliance Requirements

- All listed SEBI regulated entities must implement the Cybersecurity and Cyber Resilience Framework
- Entities under multiple regulators must follow specific principles outlined in Part-A
- Portfolio Managers and Merchant Bankers subject to re-categorization requirements
- Compliance with CERT-In cyber security audit policy guidelines
- Regular monitoring and reporting of cybersecurity measures

## Important Dates

- Original Framework: August 20, 2024
- First Clarifications: December 31, 2024
- Implementation Extension 1: March 28, 2025

## Impact Assessment

The framework represents a significant regulatory shift requiring substantial investment in cybersecurity infrastructure across all SEBI regulated entities. Multi-regulated entities face additional complexity in ensuring compliance with potentially overlapping requirements. The comprehensive nature of the framework affects operational processes, technology systems, and governance structures across the entire securities market ecosystem.
