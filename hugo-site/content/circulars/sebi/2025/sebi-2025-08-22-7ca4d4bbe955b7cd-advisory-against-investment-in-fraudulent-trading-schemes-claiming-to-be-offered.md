title: Advisory Against investment in Fraudulent Trading Schemes claiming to be offered
  to Indian residents by FPIs
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued a high-priority advisory warning investors against fraudulent trading schemes that falsely claim to offer stock market access through Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) or Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) to Indian residents. These schemes are being promoted through social media platforms, WhatsApp groups, Telegram channels, and unauthorized apps.

## Key Points

- Fraudulent schemes claiming FPI/FII access for Indian residents are circulating on social media platforms
- These schemes falsely promise institutional trading accounts, discounted IPOs, guaranteed IPO allotments, anchor book participation, and discounted block trades
- FPI investment route is generally unavailable to resident Indians with only limited exceptions under SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2019
- Investors must verify entity registration status on SEBI's website before investing
- Only use authentic trading apps from SEBI-registered intermediaries

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. This advisory reinforces existing regulations under SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2019 that restrict FPI investment route access for resident Indians.

## Compliance Requirements

- Investors must verify registration status of entities on SEBI's website at https://www.sebi.gov.in/intermediaries.html
- Use only authentic trading apps of SEBI-registered intermediaries available at https://investor.sebi.gov.in/Investor-support.html
- Exercise caution when dealing with unsolicited investment offers through social media channels
- Report suspicious schemes to SEBI

## Important Dates

- Advisory issued: August 22, 2025
- Immediate effect: Investors should exercise caution starting immediately

## Impact Assessment

This advisory addresses a significant threat to retail investor safety and market integrity. Fraudulent FPI schemes can cause substantial financial losses to unsuspecting investors and undermine confidence in legitimate market participants. The warning is particularly important given the widespread use of social media and messaging platforms for investment promotion, requiring heightened investor awareness and regulatory vigilance.
