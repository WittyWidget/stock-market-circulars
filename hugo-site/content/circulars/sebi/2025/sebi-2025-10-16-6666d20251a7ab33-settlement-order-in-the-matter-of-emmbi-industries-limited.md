## Summary

SEBI issued Settlement Order No. SO/JS/VC/2025-26/7680 against Emmbi Industries Limited (PAN: AAACE3423G) for violations of LODR Regulations. The company incorrectly showed a director as independent in the Corporate Governance Report while simultaneously including him in the promoter and promoter group list in the Shareholding Pattern Report. The case was settled through SEBI's Settlement Proceedings for Rs. 12,35,000 (Rupees Twelve Lakh Thirty Five Thousand only), paid on October 11, 2025.

## Key Points

## Compliance Requirements

- Listed companies must ensure directors are not simultaneously classified as independent directors and members of the promoter/promoter group

## Impact Assessment

**Company Impact**: Emmbi Industries Limited faces monetary penalty of Rs. 12.35 lakh and reputational impact from the settlement order. The company must ensure future compliance with director classification and disclosure requirements.

**Market Impact**: Minimal broader market impact as this is a company-specific enforcement action. However, it serves as a reminder to listed companies about the importance of accurate and consistent disclosures in corporate governance and shareholding pattern reports.

**Precedent Value**: Reinforces SEBI's strict approach to proper classification of independent directors and promoter groups, and demonstrates the settlement mechanism as an alternative to full adjudication proceedings.
