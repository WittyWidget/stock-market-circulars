title: SEBI Suspends Raima Equities Private Limited for Regulatory Violations
---

## Summary

SEBI has issued an enquiry order against Raima Equities Private Limited (Registration No. INZ000263832), recommending suspension of its broker registration for one month. The action stems from violations of Rule 8(3)(f) of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules and NSE circulars, where the broker made unauthorized investments totaling Rs. 77.64 lakh in two group companies (K B R Township Pvt Ltd and Kanodia Finance Pvt Ltd) in 2013 that were not related to securities or commodity derivatives business.

## Key Points

- Raima Equities invested Rs. 42.49 lakh in K B R Township Pvt Ltd and Rs. 35.15 lakh in Kanodia Finance Pvt Ltd
- Both group companies were NBFCs, not engaged in securities/commodity derivatives business
- Investments violated Rule 8(3)(f) of SCR Rules and NSE Circular NSE/COMP/50957 dated January 7, 2022
- SEBI inspection conducted during August 21-24, 2023 for period April 2022 to July 2023
- Designated Authority issued show-cause notice on May 7, 2024
- Final enquiry report submitted on June 28, 2024

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes introduced. The order enforces existing provisions under:
- Rule 8(3)(f) of Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957
- SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008
- Section 12(3) of SEBI Act, 1992

## Compliance Requirements

- Stock exchange members must ensure investments are only in securities or commodity derivatives related business
- Brokers must comply with group company investment restrictions as per SCR Rules
- Regular compliance monitoring of investment activities required
- Adherence to NSE circulars on member obligations

## Important Dates

- Investment violations: 2013
- SEBI inspection period: August 21-24, 2023 (covering April 2022 to July 2023)
- Show-cause notice: May 7, 2024
- Enquiry report: June 28, 2024
- Recommended suspension period: One month (timing to be determined)

## Impact Assessment

The suspension of Raima Equities Private Limited will temporarily remove one broker from the market, affecting its clients who will need to transfer their accounts or find alternative brokers. This enforcement action reinforces SEBI's commitment to ensuring brokers comply with investment restrictions and maintain focus on their core securities business. The relatively short suspension period suggests the violation was serious but not systemically threatening. The action serves as a deterrent to other intermediaries regarding unauthorized group company investments.
