## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Minimal to none. The violation relates to historical issuances from 2015, and all NCRPS have been fully redeemed since May 2022. No ongoing securities are affected.

**Company Impact:** The company has resolved the non-compliance through settlement payment of Rs 6.20 lakhs and has already optimized its capital structure by redeeming the preference shares.

**Precedential Value:** This order reinforces that private placements resulting in allotment to more than 200 persons (including through rights renunciation) trigger deemed public issue requirements under the Companies Act, 2013, requiring full prospectus compliance.
