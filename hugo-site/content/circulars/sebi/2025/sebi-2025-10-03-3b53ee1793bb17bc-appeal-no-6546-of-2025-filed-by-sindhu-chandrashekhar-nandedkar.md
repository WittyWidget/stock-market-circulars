## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6546 of 2025 filed by Sindhu Chandrashekhar Nandedkar against the CPIO's response to an RTI application dated July 15, 2025. The Authority found that the CPIO adequately addressed the queries, noting that information regarding Soil Properties and Infra India Ltd does not fall within SEBI's purview as complaints were referred to the Government of Maharashtra and Maharashtra RERA. The appeal was also partially dismissed as queries were vague and in the nature of grievance redressal, which is outside RTI Act scope.

## Key Points

- RTI application filed on July 15, 2025 (received July 16, 2025); CPIO responded on August 12, 2025
- Appeal filed on August 25, 2025 (received by Appellate Authority on September 03, 2025)
- Queries 1 and 2: Information not within SEBI's purview; complaints related to Soil Properties and Infra India Ltd referred to Government of Maharashtra
- SEBI sent letters dated April 16, 2021 to Chairman SLCC & Chief Secretary to Government of Maharashtra and Maharashtra RERA
- Query 3: Deemed vague and seeking clarification/opinion, not "information" as defined under RTI Act Section 2(f)
- Query 4: Adequately addressed with FAQs on RTI payment of fees from Department of Personnel & Training
- Authority cited precedent: Mr. T. V. Sundaresan vs. CPIO, SEBI (CIC decision dated November 24, 2021) regarding specificity of information sought

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a routine appellate order under the RTI Act, 2005.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. The order reaffirms that:
- RTI applications must seek clear, specific information available in documented form
- RTI framework does not cover grievance redressal
- Information sought must fall within the public authority's purview

## Important Dates

- July 15, 2025: RTI application filed by appellant
- July 16, 2025: Application received by SEBI
- August 12, 2025: CPIO's response issued
- August 25, 2025: Appeal filed
- September 03, 2025: Appeal received by Appellate Authority
- October 03, 2025: Appellate order issued
- April 16, 2021: SEBI letters sent to Maharashtra authorities (referenced in response)

## Impact Assessment

Minimal impact. This is an administrative RTI appellate decision with no implications for securities markets, trading operations, or regulatory compliance by market participants. The matter concerns a specific complaint about Soil Properties and Infra India Ltd that was outside SEBI's jurisdiction and properly referred to state authorities. The order reinforces existing RTI procedural requirements.
