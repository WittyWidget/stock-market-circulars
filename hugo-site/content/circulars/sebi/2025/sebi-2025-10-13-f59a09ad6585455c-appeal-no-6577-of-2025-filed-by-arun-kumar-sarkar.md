title: Appeal No. 6577 of 2025 filed by Arun Kumar Sarkar - RTI Appeal Remitted for
  De Novo Consideration
---

## Summary

The SEBI Appellate Authority under the RTI Act has remitted Appeal No. 6577 of 2025 filed by Arun Kumar Sarkar back to the CPIO for de novo consideration. The appellant had sought the second level review report of his SCORES complaint (Registration No. SEBIE/HY25/FARI/024886/1) but received an inadequate response directing him to check the SCORES portal. The Appellate Authority found the response incomplete and directed the CPIO to ascertain availability of the requested information and provide an appropriate response within 15 working days.

## Key Points

- Appellant filed RTI application on September 10, 2025 seeking second level review report of SCORES complaint
- Original complaint registered on June 25, 2025 with Registration No. SEBIE/HY25/FARI/024886/1
- Second level review conducted by Ms. Veena Kumari, AGM, NRO Department
- CPIO responded on September 20, 2025 directing appellant to check SCORES portal with login credentials
- Appellant filed appeal on September 26, 2025 contending no report was uploaded on SCORES portal
- Appellate Authority found response inadequate for a specific information request
- Matter remitted to CPIO for proper consideration under RTI Act provisions

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is a procedural order in an individual RTI appeal matter.

## Compliance Requirements

- CPIO must reconsider the RTI application de novo
- CPIO must ascertain availability of requested second level review report
- CPIO must provide appropriate response in accordance with RTI Act provisions
- Response must be sent within 15 working days from receipt of this order

## Important Dates

- **September 10, 2025**: RTI application filed by appellant
- **September 20, 2025**: CPIO's initial response
- **September 26, 2025**: Appeal filed (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00261)
- **October 13, 2025**: Appellate Authority order date
- **Within 15 working days from receipt**: Deadline for CPIO to provide fresh response

## Impact Assessment

This order has minimal market impact as it concerns an individual RTI appeal regarding access to complaint review documentation. The order reinforces the principle that CPIOs must adequately address specific information requests under the RTI Act rather than providing generic responses. The decision affects only the administrative handling of RTI applications at SEBI and does not create any compliance obligations for market participants or listed entities.
