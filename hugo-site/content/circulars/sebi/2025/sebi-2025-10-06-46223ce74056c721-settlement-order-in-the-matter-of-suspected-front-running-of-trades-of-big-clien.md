## Impact Assessment

This settlement order demonstrates SEBI's continued enforcement against front running practices and market manipulation. The case highlights the regulatory scrutiny on misuse of material non-public information by market intermediaries and their connected persons. The identification of 350 instances of front running activities involving a big client (Societe Generale) underscores the importance of broker-client confidentiality and information barriers. The settlement mechanism allows violators to resolve proceedings without prolonged litigation while ensuring deterrence through disgorgement of wrongful gains and potential penalties. The case serves as a warning to market participants about consequences of exploiting privileged trading information for personal benefit.
