## Summary

SEBI has amended the Portfolio Managers Regulations, 2020 through notification SEBI/LAD-NRO/GN/2025/260. The key changes include mandatory provision of disclosure documents to clients before entering agreements and removal of Schedule-V from the regulations. These amendments come into effect from the date of publication in the Gazette.

## Key Points

- Amendment to Regulation 20: Reference to Schedule-IV replaced with "as per Schedule-IV"
- Amendment to Regulation 22(3): Portfolio managers must now provide disclosure documents in Board-prescribed format along with Form-C certificate before client agreements
- Schedule-V has been completely removed from the regulations
- Amendments effective from September 2, 2025 (gazette publication date)

## Regulatory Changes

**Regulation 20 Amendment:** The clause (xi) now specifically refers to "as per Schedule-IV" for compliance requirements.

**Regulation 22(3) Amendment:** Portfolio managers must provide clients with:
- Disclosure documents in SEBI-prescribed format
- Certificate as per Form-C from Schedule-I
- Both documents must be provided before entering into client agreements

**Schedule Modification:** Complete removal of Schedule-V from the regulatory framework.

## Compliance Requirements

- Portfolio managers must update their client onboarding processes
- Disclosure documents must be prepared in SEBI-prescribed format
- Form-C certificates from Schedule-I must be provided to all new clients
- Existing processes need to be reviewed to ensure compliance with amended disclosure requirements
- Documentation procedures must be updated to reflect removal of Schedule-V references

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** September 2, 2025 (date of gazette publication)
- **Compliance Timeline:** Immediate compliance required for all new client agreements post-effective date

## Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:** Portfolio managers need to revise their client onboarding procedures to incorporate mandatory disclosure document provision. This may require updates to existing documentation templates and processes.

**Compliance Impact:** Enhanced transparency requirements through mandatory disclosure documents strengthen investor protection. The removal of Schedule-V simplifies the regulatory framework while maintaining essential compliance standards.

**Market Impact:** Minimal direct market impact expected as changes are primarily procedural, focusing on improving client disclosure standards rather than altering investment management practices.
