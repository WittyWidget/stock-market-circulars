  Date
---

## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6492 of 2025 filed by K Subbaiah Choudary regarding an RTI application seeking information about whistle blower policy implementation dates in listed companies. The authority ruled that the queries sought clarification/opinion rather than 'information' as defined under the RTI Act.

## Key Points

- Appeal filed on July 22, 2025 against CPIO response dated July 15, 2025
- Original RTI application dated June 19, 2025 sought implementation date of whistle blower policy
- CPIO correctly identified queries as seeking clarification/opinion, not information
- Appellant directed to refer to SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015
- Authority cited precedent from Azad Singh vs. CPIO, Oriental Insurance Company Limited

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative decision clarifying RTI Act scope.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. Reaffirms that:
- CPIO cannot create, interpret or compile information under RTI Act
- CPIO role limited to communicating existing recorded information
- Clarification/opinion requests fall outside RTI Act scope

## Important Dates

- June 19, 2025: Original RTI application filed
- July 15, 2025: CPIO response provided
- July 22, 2025: Appeal filed (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00186)
- August 12, 2025: Appeal dismissed

## Impact Assessment

Minimal impact as this is an administrative RTI matter. Reinforces boundaries of information disclosure under RTI Act. Market participants seeking whistle blower policy details should refer directly to SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 rather than filing RTI applications for clarifications.
