  Medical Facilities Information
---

## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6482 of 2025 filed by Mahesh Agarwal on August 7, 2025. The appeal challenged SEBI's denial of RTI application seeking information about medical facilities for special child dependents during service, retirement, and after demise scenarios.

## Key Points

- Appellant sought SEBI circulars on medical facilities for dependent special children under various scenarios
- SEBI denied information under Section 8(1)(a) of RTI Act as it pertains to internal functioning
- Despite denial, SEBI provided general details about medical facilities for employees and dependents
- Appellate Authority upheld the exemption citing Supreme Court precedent in ICAI v. Shaunak H. Satya
- Appeal was dismissed as no deficiency found in respondent's response

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an RTI appeal decision affirming existing information disclosure policies.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. Decision reinforces that information about internal functioning and procedures remains exempt from RTI disclosure.

## Important Dates
