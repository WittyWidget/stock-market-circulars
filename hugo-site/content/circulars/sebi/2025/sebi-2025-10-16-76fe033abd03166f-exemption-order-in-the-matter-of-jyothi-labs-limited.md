## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:** Limited direct market impact as this involves internal promoter group restructuring through family trusts. No change in overall promoter holding percentage expected. Public shareholders are not affected as exemption is sought from open offer requirements.

**Corporate Governance Impact:** Represents succession planning and wealth management restructuring within the promoter family. Transfer of shares from individual promoters to family trusts is a common estate planning mechanism.

**Operational Impact:** Minimal operational impact on Jyothi Labs Limited's business operations. The restructuring is confined to shareholding arrangements among promoters.

**Investor Considerations:** Investors should monitor final terms of exemption order and ensure that public shareholder interests are adequately protected in the restructuring process.
