## Impact Assessment

This adjudication order highlights SEBI's continued focus on ensuring merchant bankers maintain high standards of due diligence and compliance, particularly in IPO transactions. The violations related to IPO due diligence (specifically mentioning Qualitek Labs Limited) and SDD maintenance indicate systemic compliance gaps. The action serves as a reminder to all merchant bankers to:

- Strengthen internal due diligence processes for public offerings
- Implement robust systems for maintaining structural digital databases
- Ensure timely and accurate investor complaint disclosures
- Maintain comprehensive documentation of all due diligence activities
- Monitor NISM certification compliance for all associated persons

The penalty proceedings under Section 15HB of SEBI Act indicate potential monetary sanctions, which will be determined based on the adjudication process. This case underscores the regulatory scrutiny on intermediaries' operational compliance and their role as gatekeepers in capital markets.
