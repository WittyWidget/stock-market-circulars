## Summary

The Appellate Authority under the RTI Act dismissed Appeal No. 6541 of 2025 filed by Prabir Guha against the CPIO, SEBI, Mumbai. The appellant's original RTI application dated July 17, 2025 sought information about whether an amount of Rs 9,56,560/- was invested under client ID DIV86241 from 2016 to date. The respondent rejected the query as vague and not specific. The Appellate Authority upheld this decision, ruling that the query did not constitute clear, specific "information" under Section 2(f) of the RTI Act.

## Key Points

- RTI application filed on July 17, 2025 (received July 21, 2025) seeking details about investment amount under specific client ID
- CPIO responded on July 30, 2025 that query was unclear and in nature of seeking clarification
- Appeal filed September 01, 2025 and decided on September 29, 2025
- Appellate Authority concurred that query was vague and not specific
- Information under RTI Act must be clear, specific and available in records of public authority
- Appellant attempted to raise exact queries only in appeal stage, which is not permitted
- Appeal dismissed with no interference in CPIO's decision

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced by this order.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. The order reaffirms existing RTI Act principles:
- RTI applications must contain clear and specific queries
- Information sought must be believed to exist in documented or material form with the public authority
- Scope of RTI enquiry cannot be expanded at appeal stage

## Important Dates

- July 17, 2025: RTI application dated
- July 21, 2025: RTI application received by SEBI
- July 30, 2025: CPIO response issued
- September 01, 2025: Appeal received by Appellate Authority
- September 29, 2025: Appeal decision issued

## Impact Assessment

This is a procedural order with no impact on market operations, trading, or regulatory framework. It reinforces established RTI Act jurisprudence that information seekers must frame specific queries and cannot expand the scope of their enquiry at the appeal stage. The decision cites precedents from the Central Information Commission in T. V. Sundaresan vs. CPIO (November 24, 2021) and Harish Prasad Divedi vs. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (January 28, 2014).
