---

## Summary

SEBI has revised Chapter 14 of the Master Circular for Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) regarding the conversion of private listed InvITs into public InvITs. The changes streamline minimum contribution requirements from sponsors and align the public offer procedures with follow-on offer requirements instead of initial offer requirements.

## Key Points

- Framework for conversion of private listed InvIT into public InvIT has been reviewed based on market participant suggestions
- Changes recommended by the Hybrid Securities Advisory Committee (HySAC) have been incorporated
- Minimum unitholding requirements for sponsors now reference Regulation 12(3) and 12(3A) of InvIT Regulations
- Lock-in provisions for sponsor units aligned with Regulation 12(5) of InvIT Regulations
- Public offer procedures changed from initial offer requirements to follow-on offer requirements

## Regulatory Changes

**Minimum Unitholding Requirements (Para 14.6):**
- Sponsor(s) and sponsor group(s) must comply with minimum unitholding requirements under Regulation 12(3) and 12(3A) at all times

**Lock-in Provisions (Para 14.7):**
- Lock-in on sponsor units shall be as specified in Regulation 12(5) of InvIT Regulations

**Public Offer Alignment:**
- Procedures and disclosure requirements aligned with follow-on offer requirements instead of initial offer requirements
- References to "initial" changed to "follow-on" in multiple paragraphs (14.3.1, 14.5.1, 14.8.1, 14.9.1)

## Compliance Requirements

- All Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) must comply with revised framework
- Sponsor(s) and sponsor group(s) must maintain minimum unitholding as per InvIT Regulations
- InvITs seeking conversion must follow follow-on offer procedures and disclosure requirements
- Stock Exchanges and Bharat InvITs Association must disseminate circular contents on their websites

## Important Dates

- **Effective Date:** Immediate effect from August 8, 2025
