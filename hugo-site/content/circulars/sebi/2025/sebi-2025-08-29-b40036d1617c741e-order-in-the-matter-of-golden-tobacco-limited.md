  and Misrepresentation

## Summary

SEBI issued an order against Golden Tobacco Limited (GTL) and its promoters - Mr. Sanjay Dalmia, Mr. Anurag Dalmia, and Mr. Ashok Kumar Joshi - for investigation into violations during FY 2009-10 to 2020-21. GTL transferred Rs.17,517.57 lakhs to its wholly owned subsidiary Golden Realty & Infrastructure Limited (GRIL) as advances, claiming they were for acquiring development rights. However, SEBI found that only Rs.3,599.14 lakhs were returned, and Rs.11,415.52 lakhs were diverted to entities connected with promoters, constituting misrepresentation to investors.

- Only Rs.3,599.14 lakhs were returned to GTL from the advances
- Rs.11,415.52 lakhs were allegedly diverted to promoter-connected entities
- GTL claimed advances were for acquiring development rights under Joint Development Agreement with WGF Financial Services Limited
- Company underwent Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) in June 2022
- Investigation covers potential violations of SEBI Act 1992, PFUTP Regulations 2003, and LODR Regulations 2015

## Impact Assessment

High impact case involving significant fund diversion and investor misrepresentation spanning over a decade. The case highlights risks of subsidiary transactions being misused for fund diversion. GTL's insolvency proceedings indicate severe financial distress, potentially affecting investor recoveries. The order reinforces SEBI's focus on proper disclosure of related party transactions and prevention of fund siphoning through subsidiaries.
