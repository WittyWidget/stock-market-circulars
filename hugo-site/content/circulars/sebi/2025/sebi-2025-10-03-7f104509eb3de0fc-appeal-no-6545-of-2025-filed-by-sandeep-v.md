## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority rejected an RTI appeal filed by Sandeep V seeking information about implementation of Clause 9 of SEBI Circular dated November 25, 2022 regarding public disclosure of Root Cause Analysis (RCA) reports by stock exchanges NSE and BSE for technical glitches. The appeal was rejected on grounds that the information is exempt under Sections 8(1)(a), 8(1)(d) and 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act as it involves fiduciary relationship, confidential commercial information, and strategic regulatory decision-making.

## Key Points

- Appellant sought certified copies of implementation status reports, compliance submissions, exemptions/waivers, and inspection/audit reports related to Clause 9 of SEBI Circular SEBI/HO/MIRSD/TPD1/P/CIR/2022/160 dated November 25, 2022
- Application filed on August 06, 2025; CPIO response dated September 03, 2025; Appeal filed September 05, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00234)
- SEBI denied information citing it pertains to internal functioning, regulatory inputs, and strategic decision-making
- RCA reports contain critical information about trading architecture of stock broker systems and are confidential
- Information exempt under RTI Act Sections 8(1)(a) - strategic affairs, 8(1)(d) - commercial confidence/fiduciary relationship, and 8(1)(e) - third party confidential information
- Appellate Authority upheld that documents received by SEBI from entities are in fiduciary relationship and disclosure would breach confidentiality

## Regulatory Changes

- Implementation status reports and compliance submissions from stock exchanges
- Exemptions, waivers, or modifications granted regarding RCA report disclosure
