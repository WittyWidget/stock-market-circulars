This revised notice corrects an earlier demand dated March 28, 2023 which contained incorrect interest calculations. The demand arises from a refund order issued by WTM in October 2016 related to the Dolphin Universal matter.

## Key Points

- Total demand amount: Rs. 2,99,46,456.71 (Rs. 2.99 crore approximately)
- Principal refund amount ordered: Rs. 99,79,500 (Rs. 79,11,500 + Rs. 20,68,000)
- Interest component: Rs. 1,99,65,955.74 calculated at 15% p.a.
- Interest period: April 1, 2012 to October 14, 2025 (on Rs. 79.11 lakh) and April 1, 2013 to October 14, 2025 (on Rs. 20.68 lakh)
- Recovery cost: Rs. 1,000
- Payment deadline: 15 days from receipt of notice
- Seven entities named: One company and six individuals
- Original WTM order dated: October 27, 2016 (Order No. WTM/RKA/EFD/164/2016)

## Regulatory Changes

No new regulatory changes. This is an enforcement action under existing provisions of Section 28A of SEBI Act, 1992 read with Section 222 of Income-tax Act, 1961.

## Compliance Requirements

- **Payment Method**: Respondents must pay via direct credit through EFT/NEFT/RTGS to Bank of India Account No. SEBIRNCIS6364 (IFSC: BKID00VAN04), OR through online payment on SEBI's Recovery Payment module at https://siportal.sebi.gov.in, OR via payment link on SEBI Website → Enforcement → Recovery Proceedings → Pay Now
- **Payment Deadline**: Within 15 days of receipt of this notice
- **Consequence of Non-Payment**: Recovery Officer will initiate recovery proceedings under Section 28A of SEBI Act read with sections 220-227, 228A, 229 and 232 of Income-tax Act, 1961

## Important Dates

- **Original WTM Order**: October 27, 2016
- **First Notice of Demand**: March 28, 2023 (contained incorrect interest calculation)
- **Revised Notice Date**: October 14, 2025
- **Interest Calculation Period**: April 1, 2012 to October 14, 2025 (for Rs. 79.11 lakh component) and April 1, 2013 to October 14, 2025 (for Rs. 20.68 lakh component)
- **Payment Deadline**: 15 days from receipt of notice

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: Negligible direct market impact as this relates to a specific enforcement case from 2016 involving a collective investment scheme matter.

**Entity Impact**: High impact on the seven named respondents who face recovery proceedings with potential attachment and sale of movable/immovable property, arrest and detention, or appointment of receiver if payment is not made within the stipulated timeframe.

**Precedent Value**: Demonstrates SEBI's continued pursuit of recovery in older enforcement matters, including correction of calculation errors in demand notices. The 15% per annum interest rate and extended calculation period (13+ years) significantly increases the total liability from the original refund amount of Rs. 99.79 lakh to Rs. 2.99 crore.

**Recovery Modes**: In case of non-payment, SEBI can proceed with: (a) attachment and sale of movable property, (b) attachment and sale of immovable property, (c) arrest and detention, or (d) appointment of receiver for property management.
