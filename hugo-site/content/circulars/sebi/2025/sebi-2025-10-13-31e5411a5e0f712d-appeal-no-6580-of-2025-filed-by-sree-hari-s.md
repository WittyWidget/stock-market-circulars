  Grade A Recruitment

## Summary

The SEBI Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6580 of 2025 filed by Sree hari S challenging the response to his RTI application dated September 23, 2025 regarding SEBI Grade A (Assistant Manager) recruitment plans for 2025. The appellant sought information about recruitment timelines, vacancy numbers, examination schedules, internal communications, and recruitment policies. The Authority upheld the CPIO's response that most queries sought clarification/opinion rather than 'information' as defined under Section 2(f) of the RTI Act, and that certain internal documents were exempt under Section 8(1)(a).

## Key Points

- RTI application filed September 23, 2025 seeking details about SEBI Grade A recruitment for 2025
- CPIO responded September 26, 2025 citing queries as seeking clarification/opinion, not information
- Appeal (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00263) filed September 29, 2025 claiming incomplete/misleading information
- Appellate Authority upheld CPIO's response that queries cannot be construed as seeking 'information' under RTI Act
- Queries about recruitment plans, timelines, vacancy numbers deemed clarificatory in nature
- Internal communications and policy documents exempted under Section 8(1)(a) as relating to internal functioning
- SEBI informed that recruitment details are published on SEBI website when exercises are undertaken
- Vacancies arise due to promotions, resignations, and retirements, with periodic recruitment exercises

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an appellate order interpreting existing provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005, specifically:
- Section 2(f) defining 'information'
- Section 8(1)(a) exempting information relating to internal functioning that would impede the process

## Compliance Requirements

No compliance requirements for market participants. This matter pertains solely to:
- RTI procedures within SEBI
- Distinction between 'information' and 'clarification/opinion' under RTI Act
- Exemptions for internal functioning documents

- **September 26, 2025**: CPIO response provided
- **September 29, 2025**: First appeal filed (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00263)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact**: None. This is an administrative RTI matter with no implications for securities markets, trading operations, or listed entities.
