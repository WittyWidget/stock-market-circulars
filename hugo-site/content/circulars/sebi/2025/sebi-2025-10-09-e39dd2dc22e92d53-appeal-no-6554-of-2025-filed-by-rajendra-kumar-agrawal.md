## Summary

Appeal No. 6554 of 2025 filed by Rajendra Kumar Agrawal challenging SEBI's denial of information under RTI Act. The appellant sought certified copies of complete action history, documents, and correspondence related to SCORES Complaint No. SEBIP/MH12/0005487/1 concerning his shareholding in Finolex Industries Ltd. (folio no. R56842). The CPIO denied the request citing exemptions under sections 8(1)(e), 8(1)(g) and 8(1)(j) of RTI Act, claiming the information relates to third-party personal information held in fiduciary capacity and may cause unwarranted invasion of privacy.

## Key Points

- Appellant is registered first holder of shares in Finolex Industries Ltd., folio no. R56842
- Original RTI application filed on August 14, 2025; CPIO responded on September 10, 2025
- Appeal filed on September 10, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00240)
- Information requested includes action history, attachments, disposal orders, and internal correspondence for SCORES Complaint No. SEBIP/MH12/0005487/1
- Appellant also filed counter-complaint on SCORES (Complaint No. SEBIP/MH12/0006308/1) on same matter
- CPIO denied information citing sections 8(1)(e), 8(1)(g) and 8(1)(j) exemptions for third-party personal information and privacy concerns
- Dispute relates to Finolex Industries Ltd.'s refusal to transfer shares (letter dated July 27, 2006)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an individual RTI appeal matter.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. The appeal addresses information access rights under existing RTI Act provisions.

## Impact Assessment

This appeal has minimal market impact as it concerns an individual shareholder's request for information about his own SCORES complaint records. The matter involves interpretation of RTI Act exemptions regarding third-party information and privacy protections. The outcome will not affect broader market operations, trading activities, or regulatory compliance requirements for listed entities. It is limited to the specific dispute between the appellant and Finolex Industries Ltd. regarding share transfer in folio R56842.
