title: RTI Appeal No. 6462 of 2025 - Uma Sankar Mahapatra vs SEBI CPIO
---

## Summary

The SEBI Appellate Authority dismissed RTI Appeal No. 6462 of 2025 filed by Uma Sankar Mahapatra against the Chief Public Information Officer (CPIO). The appellant had sought detailed leave records of a SEBI employee including leave applications, credit balance, joining reports, and sanctioning authorities. The CPIO denied the request citing privacy exemptions under Section 8(1)(j) and 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act. The Appellate Authority upheld this denial, referencing Supreme Court precedent that employee performance and leave details constitute personal information with no public interest justification.

## Key Points

- RTI application filed on May 18, 2025 seeking comprehensive leave records of a SEBI employee
- CPIO denied request on June 2, 2025 citing privacy exemptions under RTI Act Section 8(1)(j) and 8(1)(e)
- Appeal filed on June 28, 2025 challenging the denial
- Appellate Authority dismissed appeal citing Supreme Court judgment in Girish Ramchandra Deshpande case
- Employee service conditions governed by SEBI (Employees' Service) Regulations, 2001

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative order interpreting existing RTI Act provisions regarding disclosure of employee personal information.

## Compliance Requirements

- RTI applicants cannot claim employee leave details as matter of right
- SEBI officials can deny requests for employee personal information under Section 8(1)(j) exemption
- Public interest test required for disclosure of employee personal information
- Service regulations available on SEBI website for general reference

## Important Dates

- May 18, 2025: Original RTI application filed
- June 2, 2025: CPIO response denying information

## Impact Assessment

It reinforces established precedent that employee personal information including leave records are protected under RTI Act privacy exemptions unless compelling public interest exists. The decision maintains balance between transparency obligations and employee privacy rights within SEBI operations.
