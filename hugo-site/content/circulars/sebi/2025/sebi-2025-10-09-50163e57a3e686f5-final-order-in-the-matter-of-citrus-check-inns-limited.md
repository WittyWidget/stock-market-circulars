## Summary

SEBI issued a final order under sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B of the SEBI Act, 1992 against Citrus Check Inns Limited (CIN: U55101MH2011PLC222394) and its four directors - Omprakash Basantlal Goenka, Prakash Ganpat Utekar, Venkatraman Natrajan, and Narayan Shivram Kotnis. The order follows investigation into allegations that Citrus operated a 'Ponzi Scheme' and mobilized funds through collective investment schemes without obtaining registration as required under Section 12(1B) of the SEBI Act and Regulation 3 of the CIS Regulations, 1999.

## Key Points

- SEBI received complaint on January 17, 2014 alleging Citrus was running a Ponzi scheme and refusing refunds to investors
- Preliminary examination found Citrus engaged in mobilization of funds constituting 'collective investment scheme' (CIS) without registration
- Ad interim ex-parte order issued on June 03, 2015 against Citrus and four directors
- Confirmatory order passed on August 24, 2015 directing SEBI to conclude investigation
- SAT initially set aside SEBI orders on February 03, 2016, but Supreme Court reversed SAT decision on November 09, 2016
- Supreme Court directed SEBI to complete investigation and determine CIS status, while prohibiting asset alienation without SEBI permission
- Case reference: WTM/AN/IVD/ID5/31715/2025-26

## Regulatory Changes

This order reinforces existing regulatory framework under:
- Section 11AA of SEBI Act, 1992 (definition of CIS)
- Section 12(1B) of SEBI Act (registration requirement)
- Regulation 3 of SEBI (Collective Investment Scheme) Regulations, 1999
- Sections 11(1), 11(4) and 11B of SEBI Act (enforcement powers)

## Compliance Requirements

Directions issued in the interim order included:
- Prohibition on collecting fresh money from customers/investors under existing schemes
- Prohibition on launching new schemes or plans
- Prohibition on raising fresh money from group companies
- Prohibition on floating new companies to raise funds
- Requirement to submit full inventory of assets obtained through funds raised
- Prohibition on disposal or alienation of properties/assets obtained through public funds
- Prohibition on diversion of funds raised from public kept in bank accounts or custody of Citrus, group companies, promoters, LLPs or proprietary concerns

## Important Dates

- January 17, 2014: Complaint received by SEBI
- June 03, 2015: Ad interim ex-parte order issued
- August 24, 2015: Confirmatory order passed
- February 03, 2016: SAT order (later set aside)
- November 09, 2016: Supreme Court order setting aside SAT decision and directing investigation completion
- Order reference: WTM/AN/IVD/ID5/31715/2025-26 (2025-26 financial year)

## Impact Assessment

This enforcement action has significant implications for:
- **Investor protection**: Addresses fraudulent fund mobilization schemes targeting public investors
- **Market integrity**: Demonstrates SEBI's commitment to prosecuting unregistered CIS operators
- **Precedent value**: Confirms SEBI's authority to investigate and take action against Ponzi schemes disguised as business ventures
- **Director accountability**: Holds individual directors personally liable for company's regulatory violations
- **Asset preservation**: Prevents dissipation of investor funds through asset alienation restrictions

The matter involves investigation into the nature of Citrus's business model and whether it constitutes a collective investment scheme requiring regulatory registration and oversight.
