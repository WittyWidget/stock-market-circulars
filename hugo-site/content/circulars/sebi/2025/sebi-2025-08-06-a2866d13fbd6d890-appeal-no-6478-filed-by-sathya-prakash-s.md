The authority upheld CPIO's response that the queries sought clarification/opinion rather than information under the RTI Act.

## Key Points

- CPIO responded on July 09, 2025 stating queries were seeking clarification/opinion, not information
- Appeal filed on July 09, 2025 claiming incomplete/misleading information was provided
- Appellate Authority confirmed queries cannot be construed as seeking 'information' under RTI Act Section 2(f)
- CPIO directed appellant to check SEBI website for registered intermediaries list

## Regulatory Changes

## Compliance Requirements

- Complaints regarding unauthorized activities can be lodged through SCORES portal

## Important Dates
