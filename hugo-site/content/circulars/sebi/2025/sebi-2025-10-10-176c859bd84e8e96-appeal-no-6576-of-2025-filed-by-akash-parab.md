## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6576 of 2025 filed by Akash Parab against the CPIO's response to his RTI application dated September 17, 2025. The appellant sought information about a purported 'PhD Court', advocate payments by SEBI in RTI matters over the last 5 years, and related circulars. The Appellate Authority upheld the CPIO's decision that queries seeking clarification, opinion, or confirmation do not constitute 'information' under Section 2(f) of the RTI Act, and that collating advocate payment details would disproportionately divert SEBI's resources under Section 7(9) of the RTI Act.

## Key Points

- RTI application filed on September 17, 2025, seeking information about alleged 'PhD Court' and advocate payments
- CPIO responded on September 26, 2025, stating queries sought clarification/opinion, not information under RTI Act
- Appeal filed on September 26, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00259) claiming incomplete/misleading information
- Appellate Authority confirmed queries requesting clarification, opinion, or confirmation are not 'information' under Section 2(f) of RTI Act
- Collating advocate payment data from multiple files would disproportionately divert SEBI resources per Section 7(9)
- CPIO directed appellant to SEBI's Annual Statement of Accounts on website for expense details
- Reliance placed on Azad Singh vs. CPIO, Oriental Insurance Company Limited (CIC order dated March 23, 2021)
