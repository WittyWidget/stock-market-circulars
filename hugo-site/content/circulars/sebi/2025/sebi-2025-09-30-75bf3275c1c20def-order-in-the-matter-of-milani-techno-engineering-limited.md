## Impact Assessment

**Investor Impact:** Investors who subscribed to RCPS during FY 2011-12 remain at risk without refunds. The enforcement action aims to protect investor interests and recover funds.

**Company Impact:** MTEL and its directors face potential penalties, disgorgement orders, and directions under SEBI Act for violations spanning over a decade.

**Market Impact:** Limited broader market impact as MTEL is an unlisted company. However, this reinforces SEBI's commitment to pursuing historical fund mobilization violations and holding directors accountable regardless of tenure.

**Precedent Value:** Establishes that both directors during violation period and subsequent directors have obligations regarding illegal fund mobilization and refunds.
