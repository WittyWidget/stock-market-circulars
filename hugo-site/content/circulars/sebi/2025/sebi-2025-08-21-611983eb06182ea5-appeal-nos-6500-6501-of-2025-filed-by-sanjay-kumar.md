title: RTI Appeals 6500 & 6501 of 2025 - Rejection of Repetitive Mutual Fund Information
  Requests
---

## Summary

SEBI's First Appellate Authority dismissed RTI Appeals 6500 & 6501 of 2025 filed by Sanjay Kumar seeking mutual fund investment details. The appeals were rejected as the information is not maintained by SEBI and the requests were repetitive in nature, having been previously addressed in Appeal 6379 of 2025.

## Key Points

- Appellant sought mutual fund investment details including AMC names, folio numbers, scheme names, investment modes, and current valuations
- Applications were addressed to CPIOs at CAMS and KFintech, which are private entities not covered under RTI Act
- SEBI confirmed the requested information is not maintained in normal course of securities market regulation
- Similar requests were previously made and addressed in RTI application SEBIH/R/E/25/00538 dated April 25, 2025
- Appeals deemed repetitive citing Central Information Commission precedent on constructive res judicata

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements for market participants.

## Important Dates

- Original applications: June 14, 2025 and June 18, 2025
- SEBI responses: July 4, 2025 and July 10, 2025
- Appeals filed: August 1, 2025 and August 4, 2025
- Previous similar application: April 25, 2025
- Previous FAA order: May 23, 2025

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is an administrative RTI matter. Clarifies that mutual fund investment details are not maintained by SEBI and reinforces principles against repetitive RTI applications under established legal precedents.
