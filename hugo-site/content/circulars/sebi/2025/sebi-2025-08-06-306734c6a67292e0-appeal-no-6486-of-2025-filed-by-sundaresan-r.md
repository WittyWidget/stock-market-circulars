title: Appeal No. 6486 of 2025 filed by Sundaresan R - RTI Application Rejected for
  Vague Queries
---

## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6486 of 2025 filed by Sundaresan R, upholding the CPIO's rejection of an RTI application. The appellant sought information about restrictions on old survey numbers, but the queries were deemed vague and non-specific, failing to meet RTI Act requirements for clear and specific information requests.

## Key Points

- Appeal filed on July 15, 2025 against CPIO's response dated July 10, 2025
- Original RTI application dated June 23, 2025 contained 10 queries about survey number restrictions
- CPIO rejected application stating queries were vague and not specific enough to constitute "information" under RTI Act
- Appellate Authority concurred with CPIO's assessment citing established legal precedent
- Reference made to PACL matters available on SEBI website

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative decision on RTI application procedures.

## Compliance Requirements

RTI applications must contain clear, specific queries for information believed to exist in documented form with the public authority. Vague, broad, or general queries do not qualify for disclosure under the RTI Act.

## Important Dates

- June 23, 2025: Original RTI application filed
- July 10, 2025: CPIO response rejecting application
- July 15, 2025: Appeal filed (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00180)
- August 6, 2025: Appellate Authority order issued

## Impact Assessment

Minimal impact as this is a procedural RTI matter. Reinforces existing standards for RTI applications requiring specific and clear information requests. No market operations or trading activities affected.
