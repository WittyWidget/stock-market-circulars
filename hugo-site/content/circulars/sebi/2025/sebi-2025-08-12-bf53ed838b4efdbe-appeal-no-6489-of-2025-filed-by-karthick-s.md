## Impact Assessment

Limited direct market impact as this is an administrative RTI appeal decision. However, it highlights concerns about platform security and unauthorized trading execution. The case demonstrates limitations of RTI Act in obtaining detailed regulatory enforcement information, as such details are typically available in public domain through SEBI website when actions are taken.
