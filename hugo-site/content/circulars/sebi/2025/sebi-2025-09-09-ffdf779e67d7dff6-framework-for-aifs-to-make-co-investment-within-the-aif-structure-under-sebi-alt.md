title: Framework for AIFs to make co-investment within the AIF structure under SEBI
  (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012
---

## Summary

SEBI has amended the Alternative Investment Funds Regulations, 2012 to permit Category I and Category II AIFs to offer co-investment facility to accredited investors by launching separate co-investment schemes (CIV schemes) within the AIF structure. This framework provides an additional route for co-investment alongside the existing Portfolio Management Services route.

## Key Points

- Category I and II AIFs can now launch separate CIV schemes for co-investment facility
- Each CIV scheme must have separate bank and demat accounts with ring-fenced assets
- Co-investment limit: maximum 3x of investor's contribution in the main AIF scheme for the same investee company
- Certain institutional investors (DFIs, SIDCs, government entities) are exempt from the 3x limit
- CIV schemes cannot borrow funds or engage in leverage
- Investors excluded from main scheme investments cannot co-invest in the same companies

## Regulatory Changes

- Amendment to SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 notified on September 9, 2025
- Introduction of sub-regulation 7 of regulation 17A allowing co-investment through CIV schemes
- New operational framework specified through this circular
- Requirement for shelf placement memorandum filing as per regulation 17(A)(2)

## Compliance Requirements

- AIF managers must file shelf placement memorandum including principal terms, governance structure, and regulatory framework
- Maintain separate bank and demat accounts for each CIV scheme
- Ensure ring-fencing of assets between schemes
- Comply with co-investment limits (3x restriction for most investors)
- Ensure CIV schemes don't facilitate investments that investors cannot make directly
- Verify that investee companies can receive direct investments from CIV scheme investors
- Maintain pro-rata rights for CIV scheme investors in investments and distributions

## Important Dates

- Effective Date: September 9, 2025 (regulation amendment notification date)
- No specific implementation deadlines mentioned in the circular

## Impact Assessment

This framework enhances ease of doing business for AIFs by providing greater flexibility in structuring co-investment opportunities. It particularly benefits institutional investors who can now access co-investment opportunities through a regulated AIF structure rather than only through the PMS route. The 3x limit ensures proportionate co-investment while exemptions for government and multilateral institutions recognize their different risk profiles and investment mandates.
