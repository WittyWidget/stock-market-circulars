## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6472 of 2025 filed by Nitin Goradia challenging the rejection of his RTI application. The appellant sought information about procedures for filing misconduct complaints against SEBI employees, which was deemed a hypothetical query not qualifying as 'information' under the RTI Act.

## Key Points

- SEBI responded on June 30, 2025, stating the query was hypothetical and seeking clarification/opinion
- Appeal filed on July 2, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00169) was dismissed
- Appellate Authority confirmed the query doesn't constitute 'information' under Section 2(f) of RTI Act
- Appellant had previously filed 7 RTI applications with SEBI, with appeals dismissed for similar reasons

## Regulatory Changes

- July 2, 2025: Appeal filed
