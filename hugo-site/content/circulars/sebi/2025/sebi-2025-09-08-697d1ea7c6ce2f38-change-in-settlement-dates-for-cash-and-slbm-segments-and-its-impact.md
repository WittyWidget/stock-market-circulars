## Summary

SEBI has announced revised settlement dates for cash, SLBM (Securities Lending and Borrowing Mechanism), and derivative segments following the declaration of September 8, 2025 as an additional settlement holiday alongside September 5, 2025.

## Key Points

- September 5 and 8, 2025 declared as settlement holidays by Clearing Corporations
- Derivative segment settlements consolidated for three trading days
- Cash and SLBM segment settlements split into two batches
- Stock exchanges have informed all stakeholders about corporate action date impacts

## Regulatory Changes

- Extended settlement cycles implemented to accommodate dual holiday period
- Consolidated settlement approach for derivatives segment
- Staggered settlement schedule for cash and SLBM segments

## Compliance Requirements

- Trading members must adhere to revised settlement schedules
- Stock exchanges must issue circulars to all stakeholders
- Corporate action ex-dates and cum-dates may be impacted
- All market participants must adjust operational processes accordingly

## Important Dates

- **September 4, 2025 (Thursday)**: Trading day - settlement on September 9
- **September 5, 2025 (Friday)**: Trading day, settlement holiday - settlement on September 9
- **September 8, 2025 (Monday)**: Trading day, settlement holiday - settlement on September 10
- **September 9, 2025 (Tuesday)**: Settlement day for Sep 4-5 trades (cash/SLBM) and Sep 4-5-8 trades (derivatives)
- **September 10, 2025 (Wednesday)**: Settlement day for Sep 8-9 trades (cash/SLBM)

## Impact Assessment

**Market Operations**: Significant disruption to normal T+1 settlement cycle, requiring operational adjustments across all market segments. **Liquidity**: Potential temporary liquidity constraints due to delayed settlements. **Corporate Actions**: Ex-dates and cum-dates for corporate actions may be affected, requiring careful coordination between issuers and exchanges. **Risk Management**: Extended settlement periods may increase counterparty risk exposure temporarily.
