## Impact Assessment

This is an intra-family restructuring transaction involving transfer of promoter shares to a family trust. The proposed acquisition involves shares held by Mr. Chetankumar Chhaganlal Vaghasia (14.97% stake) being transferred to Vaghasia Family Trust. This restructuring is typical for estate planning and succession planning purposes within promoter families. The transaction does not involve change in control or acquisition from public shareholders, hence the exemption application from mandatory open offer requirements. Impact on minority shareholders is minimal as this is a promoter group internal reorganization.
