## Summary

SEBI's appellate authority rejected Appeal No. 6470 of 2025 filed by Ajit Kumar under the Right to Information Act. Kumar sought written clarification on whether any complaint, case, or investigation was pending against him in SEBI records, as this was allegedly blocking his employment with a cruise company. The authority ruled that the query sought clarification/opinion rather than information as defined under RTI Act.

## Key Points

- Ajit Kumar filed RTI application transferred from Department of Economic Affairs on June 13, 2025
- Kumar needed clarification for cruise vessel employment as Electrical Fitter with Princess Cruise Lines
- CSSI informed Kumar that SEBI complaint records might be blocking his onboarding
- SEBI CPIO responded on June 27, 2025 that query seeks clarification/opinion, not information
- Appeal filed on July 2, 2025 claiming incomplete/misleading information
- Appellate authority upheld CPIO decision on grounds that RTI Act doesn't require creating interpretations

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes announced in this order.

## Compliance Requirements

Confirms that public authorities under RTI Act are not required to:
- Create information or interpretations
- Provide opinions, advice, or clarifications
- Analyze documents to provide customized responses
- Conduct research to deduce information from existing material

## Important Dates

- June 13, 2025: RTI application transferred to SEBI
- June 27, 2025: SEBI CPIO response date
- July 2, 2025: Appeal filed (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00167)

## Impact Assessment

This order has minimal market impact as it pertains to individual RTI compliance rather than regulatory policy. It reinforces established principles that RTI authorities communicate existing information rather than create new interpretations or opinions for applicants.
