title: RTI Appeal No. 6490 of 2025 - Puneet Pandey vs CPIO SEBI Mumbai Dismissed
---

## Summary

SEBI's appellate authority dismissed RTI Appeal No. 6490 of 2025 filed by Puneet Pandey against CPIO SEBI Mumbai. The appellant sought information about action taken against Groww's customer support staff following a complaint about rude behavior. The authority ruled that the query was a grievance/complaint rather than a request for information under the RTI Act.

## Key Points

- Appeal filed on July 19, 2025 regarding May 27, 2025 RTI application
- Original complaint involved alleged rude behavior by Groww customer support staff named Anjali
- SEBI respondent correctly identified the query as grievance rather than RTI-eligible information
- Appellant was appropriately guided to SCORES portal for grievance redressal
- Appeal dismissed on August 12, 2025 by Appellate Authority Ruchi Chojer

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. The order reaffirms existing RTI Act interpretation that grievance redressal falls outside RTI scope.

## Compliance Requirements

- RTI applications must seek "information" as defined under Section 2(f) of RTI Act, not grievance redressal
- Complaints against intermediaries should be filed through SCORES portal
- Public can use SEBI helpline numbers for securities market queries

## Important Dates

- May 27, 2025: Original RTI application filed
- June 18, 2025: CPIO response provided
- July 19, 2025: Appeal filed (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00184)
- August 12, 2025: Appeal dismissed

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact. This administrative order clarifies RTI Act scope and reinforces proper channels for investor grievances. No effect on trading, listings, or market operations. Serves as precedent for similar RTI appeals involving complaint matters.
