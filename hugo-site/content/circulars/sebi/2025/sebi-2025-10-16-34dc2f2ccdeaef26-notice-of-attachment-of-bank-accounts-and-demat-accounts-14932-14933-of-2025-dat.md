## Impact Assessment

This is a targeted enforcement action against Rathi Ispat Ltd. and does not have broader market implications. The attachment of bank and demat accounts is a standard recovery mechanism used by SEBI to recover dues from defaulting entities. Impact is high for Rathi Ispat Ltd. specifically, but limited for the broader market. This action demonstrates SEBI's continued efforts to enforce compliance and recover dues from defaulters.
