## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority rejected Appeal No. 6574 of 2025 filed by Omkar Mukund Darunkar regarding reservation benefits for Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD) in SEBI Grade A and Grade B examinations. The appeal was rejected because the original RTI application dated August 07, 2025 sought clarifications and opinions rather than information as defined under Section 2(f) of the RTI Act, 2005.

## Key Points

- RTI application filed on August 07, 2025 through RTI MIS Portal
- CPIO responded on September 03, 2025 stating queries were seeking clarification/opinion, not information
- Appeal filed on September 24, 2025 (Reg. No. SEBIH/A/E/25/00257)
- Appellate Authority upheld CPIO's decision that queries cannot be construed as seeking 'information' under RTI Act
- Authority cited precedent from Central Information Commission case Azad Singh vs. CPIO, Oriental Insurance Company Limited (March 23, 2021)
- CPIO not obligated to provide clarification, opinion, or confirmation under RTI Act

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative order on an RTI appeal.

## Compliance Requirements

No compliance requirements for market participants. This order clarifies the scope of information requests under the RTI Act but does not create new obligations for regulated entities.

## Important Dates

- August 07, 2025: RTI application filed
- September 03, 2025: CPIO response date
- September 24, 2025: Appeal filed
- October 10, 2025: Appellate Authority order date

## Impact Assessment

This order has no impact on market operations, trading activities, or compliance requirements for regulated entities. It is an internal administrative matter concerning RTI procedures and the distinction between information requests versus requests for clarification or opinion. The order reinforces that CPIOs under the RTI Act are communicators of existing recorded information and are not required to create information, conduct research, analyze documents, or provide opinions.
