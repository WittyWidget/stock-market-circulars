title: RTI Appeal No. 6453 of 2025 - Pavan Maroti Bodke vs CPIO SEBI Mumbai
---

## Summary

The SEBI Appellate Authority dismissed RTI Appeal No. 6453 of 2025 filed by Pavan Maroti Bodke against CPIO SEBI Mumbai. The appellant sought information about policies regarding PAN and email ID blocking in SEBI SCORES system, restrictions on trading/investment after such blocking, and official definitions of credentials. The authority upheld the CPIO's response that such queries seek clarification rather than information under the RTI Act.

## Key Points

- Appeal filed on June 26, 2025 regarding RTI application dated June 5, 2025
- Appellant sought policies on PAN/email blocking in SCORES system and related trading restrictions
- CPIO responded that queries seek clarification, not information under RTI Act Section 2(f)
- Appellate Authority concurred with CPIO's position citing CIC precedent
- Authority noted CPIO appropriately guided appellant to relevant FAQs on SCORES and SEBI websites

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative RTI appellate order clarifying the scope of information disclosure obligations under the RTI Act.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. The order reinforces that CPIOs are not obligated to provide clarifications, opinions, or create new information under RTI Act - only to provide existing recorded information.

## Important Dates

- RTI Application: June 5, 2025
- CPIO Response: June 25, 2025  
- Appeal Filed: June 26, 2025
- Appeal Registration: SEBIH/A/E/25/00151

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this is an administrative matter regarding RTI procedures. The order clarifies that information seekers must refer to publicly available FAQs (Nos. 7, 32, 33 & 34) on SCORES and SEBI websites for guidance on system policies rather than seeking interpretative responses through RTI applications.
