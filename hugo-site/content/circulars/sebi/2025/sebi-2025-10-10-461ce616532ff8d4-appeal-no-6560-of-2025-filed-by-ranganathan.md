## Impact Assessment

This RTI appeal order has minimal direct market impact as it concerns information disclosure procedures under the RTI Act. The appeal relates to transparency in the PACL investor refund process managed by the Justice (Retd.) R.M. Lodha Committee. The document demonstrates ongoing investor interest in obtaining detailed information about PACL investigation status, refund disbursements, claim processing timelines, and asset recovery efforts. The incomplete nature of the provided document prevents assessment of the final appellate decision and its implications for information transparency.
