The appellant sought information about the step-by-step refund process and time limits for claiming refunds. The authority confirmed that SEBI had adequately provided information about the refund mechanism and that the cut-off date of July 2, 2018, for receiving refund applications was final.

- Final cut-off date for refund applications was July 2, 2018
- No applications accepted after the cut-off date
- Appellate Authority found SEBI's response adequate and dismissed the appeal

The dismissal of the appeal confirms the finality of the July 2, 2018 cut-off date for refund claims. This provides clarity to other potential claimants that no further refund applications will be considered for Sahara Housing Investment Corporation Limited or Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited investments.
