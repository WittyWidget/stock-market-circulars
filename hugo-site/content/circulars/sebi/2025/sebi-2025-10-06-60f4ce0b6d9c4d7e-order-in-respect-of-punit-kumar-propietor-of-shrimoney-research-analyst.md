## Impact Assessment

**Regulatory Impact:** This enforcement action reinforces SEBI's strict stance against research analysts who guarantee returns or mislead clients, key violations under PFUTP Regulations. It emphasizes the importance of proper disclosure and record-keeping requirements for intermediaries.

**Market Impact:** Limited direct market impact as this concerns an individual research analyst. However, it serves as a deterrent for other research analysts and intermediaries regarding compliance with disclosure norms and prohibition against guaranteed returns.

**Compliance Impact:** Research analysts and similar intermediaries should review their practices to ensure full compliance with disclosure requirements, maintain proper documentation of research rationale, and avoid any communications that could be construed as guaranteeing returns or misleading clients.
