This exemption order facilitates internal promoter group restructuring through a family trust mechanism without triggering mandatory open offer obligations. The transaction involves transfer of promoter shares to a family trust structure, which is a common estate planning and succession planning tool. Impact is limited to the company's internal shareholding structure with no immediate effect on public shareholders or market operations. The 32.66% promoter holding will be reorganized under the trust structure while maintaining overall control dynamics.
