## Impact Assessment

**Entity-Specific Impact:** High - First Overseas Capital Ltd. faces six-month suspension of merchant banking registration and regulatory censure, effectively preventing it from conducting merchant banking activities during the suspension period.

**Market Impact:** Low to Medium - Limited broader market impact as this is an enforcement action against a single intermediary. However, it reinforces SEBI's strict enforcement of capital adequacy norms for intermediaries.

**Regulatory Precedent:** Demonstrates SEBI's commitment to ensuring financial soundness of market intermediaries through strict enforcement of net worth requirements. Sets precedent for consequences of sustained capital adequacy violations across multiple financial years.
