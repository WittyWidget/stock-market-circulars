title: Extension of timeline for implementation of SEBI Circular on margin obligations
  through pledge/re-pledge in Depository System
---

## Summary

SEBI has extended the implementation timeline for its circular on margin obligations to be given by way of pledge/re-pledge in the Depository System from September 1, 2025 to October 10, 2025. The extension was granted following representations from depositories CDSL and NSDL requesting additional time for system developments and end-to-end testing.

## Key Points

- Original implementation date was September 1, 2025
- New implementation date is October 10, 2025
- Extension granted based on requests from CDSL and NSDL depositories
- Additional time needed for system developments and comprehensive testing
- Aims to ensure smooth implementation without market disruption

## Regulatory Changes

No changes to the underlying regulatory framework - only the implementation timeline has been modified. The core provisions of the June 3, 2025 circular on margin obligations through pledge/re-pledge remain unchanged.

## Compliance Requirements

- Stock Exchanges, Depositories and Clearing Corporations must notify members/participants of the timeline extension
- Entities must disseminate information on their websites
- Appropriate systems and procedures must be implemented for compliance
- Necessary amendments to Bye-laws, Rules and Regulations must be made
- All preparations must be completed by the new deadline of October 10, 2025

## Important Dates

- **August 18, 2025**: Circular issued announcing extension
- **October 10, 2025**: New implementation deadline for margin obligations via pledge/re-pledge
- **Original deadline**: September 1, 2025 (now extended)

## Impact Assessment

The extension provides relief to depositories and market participants, allowing additional time for system readiness and testing. This should help prevent potential disruptions that could have occurred with insufficient preparation time. The 39-day extension demonstrates SEBI's commitment to ensuring smooth implementation of critical market infrastructure changes while maintaining the integrity of the margin system.
