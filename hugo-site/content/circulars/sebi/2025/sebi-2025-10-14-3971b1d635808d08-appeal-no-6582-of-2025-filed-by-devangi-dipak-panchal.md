## Summary

The Appellate Authority disposed of Appeal No. 6582 of 2025 filed by Devangi Dipak Panchal regarding an RTI application seeking information about the authorization of Shri S. Ramann, Officer on Special Duty (OSD), who issued a Show Cause Notice dated December 1, 2009. The Authority partially allowed the appeal, finding that query B(1) was adequately addressed but query B(2) required reconsideration, and remitted the matter back to the CPIO for fresh response.

## Key Points

- Appellant sought information about grade/position and appointment order of OSD who issued SCN No. ISD/SR/BJD/SCN/186094/2009 dated December 1, 2009
- CPIO informed that Shri S. Ramann was on deputation as Chief General Manager (CGM) as on December 1, 2009
- CPIO provided website link for delegation of powers but document was from 2019, not 2009 as requested
- Appellate Authority found query B(1) adequately addressed but query B(2) not properly responded to
- Matter remitted back to CPIO for de novo consideration of query B(2)

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced. This is an administrative order in an RTI appeal matter.

## Compliance Requirements

- CPIO, SEBI Mumbai is directed to reconsider query B(2) from the original RTI application
- CPIO must send appropriate response to appellant in terms of RTI Act within 15 working days from receipt of order
- CPIO must ascertain availability of requested information (appointment order/authority letter from 2009) and provide same in accordance with RTI Act provisions

## Important Dates

- **September 10, 2025**: Original RTI application filed by appellant
- **September 26, 2025**: CPIO response to RTI application

## Impact Assessment

This order has no market impact. It is an administrative matter relating to transparency and information disclosure under the RTI Act. The case pertains to a historical Show Cause Notice from 2009 and involves procedural compliance with information requests. The order ensures proper implementation of RTI Act requirements by directing the CPIO to provide complete information about authorization and delegation of powers as they existed in 2009, rather than current documentation.
