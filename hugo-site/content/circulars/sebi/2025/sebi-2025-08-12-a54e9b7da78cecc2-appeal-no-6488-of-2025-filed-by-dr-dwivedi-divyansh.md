- Request for STT revenue data from option premium turnover and conflict-of-interest declarations denied as information not available
- Appeal challenges SEBI's regulatory approach to close-strike weekly options causing over 90% retail losses
- References global regulators (ESMA, FCA, ASIC) banning close-strike expiries as exploitative
