## Summary

SEBI's Appellate Authority dismissed Appeal No. 6503 of 2025 filed by Dheeraj Dasila under the RTI Act. The appellant sought information about reopening the PACL refund portal for investors who missed the deadline, but SEBI confirmed no such information is available as the matter is handled by the Justice R.M. Lodha Committee.

## Key Points

- Appellant filed RTI application on June 27, 2025 seeking information about PACL refund portal reopening
- SEBI responded on July 24, 2025 stating requested information not available
- Appeal filed on July 30, 2025 claiming incomplete/misleading information
- Appellate Authority confirmed SEBI's response was appropriate as no such information exists
- Justice R.M. Lodha Committee handles PACL property disposal and investor repayment matters

## Regulatory Changes

No regulatory changes introduced by this order.

## Compliance Requirements

No new compliance requirements. Existing PACL-related information remains available on SEBI website including status reports, FAQs, press releases and public notices.

## Important Dates

- June 27, 2025: RTI application filed
- July 24, 2025: SEBI response provided
- July 30, 2025: Appeal filed
- August 21, 2025: Appeal dismissed

## Impact Assessment

Minimal market impact as this relates to an individual RTI case regarding historical PACL matter. Confirms existing arrangement where Justice R.M. Lodha Committee continues to handle PACL investor refund processes as per Supreme Court order dated February 2, 2016.
