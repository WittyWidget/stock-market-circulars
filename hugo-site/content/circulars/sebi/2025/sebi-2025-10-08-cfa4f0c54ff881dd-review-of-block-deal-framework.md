## Summary

SEBI has comprehensively revised the Block Deal Framework through Circular SEBI/HO/MRD/POD-III/CIR/P/2025/134 dated October 08, 2025. The new framework introduces two distinct block deal windows - a morning window (08:45 AM to 09:00 AM) using previous day closing price as reference, and an afternoon window (02:05 PM to 02:20 PM) using VWAP calculated from 01:45 PM to 02:00 PM trades. The minimum order size remains INR 25 crores with a price range of ±3% from applicable reference price. These provisions apply to both T+1 and optional T+0 settlement cycles.

## Key Points

- Morning Block Deal Window: 08:45 AM to 09:00 AM (reference: previous day closing price)
- Afternoon Block Deal Window: 02:05 PM to 02:20 PM (reference: VWAP from 01:45 PM to 02:00 PM)
- Stock exchanges can set trading hours between 08:45 AM to 05:00 PM
- Price range: ±3% of applicable reference price in respective windows
- Minimum order size: INR 25 crores per trade
- All trades must result in delivery and cannot be squared off or reversed
- VWAP calculation and dissemination period: 02:00 PM to 02:05 PM
- Block deal information disclosure required same day after market hours
- Provisions applicable to both T+1 and optional T+0 settlement cycles

## Impact Assessment

**Market Impact:**
- Provides institutional investors and large traders with two distinct trading opportunities during the day
- Morning window enables pre-market block execution at previous day's closing price, beneficial for overnight liquidity needs
- Afternoon window offers intraday price discovery through VWAP-based execution, reducing information asymmetry
- Dual-window structure may increase block trading activity by accommodating different trading strategies
- Enhanced transparency through same-day disclosure requirements

**Operational Impact:**
- Stock exchanges must upgrade systems to support dual-window operations with different reference pricing mechanisms
- Real-time VWAP calculation and dissemination infrastructure required
- Surveillance systems need enhancement to monitor two separate windows with different pricing dynamics
- Clearing and settlement infrastructure must handle block deals across multiple windows and settlement cycles (T+0 and T+1)

**Price Discovery Impact:**
- Morning window provides stability using previous day closing price as anchor
- Afternoon window improves intraday price discovery by using recent VWAP
- ±3% price band limits potential market impact while allowing reasonable flexibility

**Liquidity Impact:**
- May improve overall market liquidity by providing dedicated large-trade execution mechanism
- Mandatory delivery requirement ensures genuine trading interest and reduces speculative activity
- INR 25 crore minimum maintains focus on institutional-sized transactions

**Systemic Impact:**
- Applies uniformly across all recognized stock exchanges and clearing corporations
- Extension to T+0 settlement cycle ensures framework consistency across different settlement mechanisms
- Based on regulatory working group and market advisory committee recommendations, indicating broad stakeholder consultation
